            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE PREFACE, Rendering an Account of this <hi>Publication.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>
               <hi>COmfort</hi> is a thing ſo pleaſing, ſo amia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, ſo tempting, that it invites every ones Embraces, and oft is liable to the Confident and Impudent Arreſts and Rapes of Preſumptious and Wanton Hearts, which in a Licentious Age, do not entertain ſo much Soli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citude to be Good as Quiet. <hi>Degenerate Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi> is loth to diveſt it ſelf of its evil Diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions, as thoſe Satisfactions which are agreeable to its predominate Qualities and Conſtitution, becauſe this imports no leſs than its own Diſſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and Ruin, (as far as Corrupt) and in this
<pb facs="tcp:100687:3"/>Gulf the Generality Periſh, it being, like the Dead Sea, ſmooth though muddy. But when a daring Light boldly ruſhes into the Conſcience, and as our Redeemer once in <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turns the Tables, and with Whips and Scorpions drives out the old Buyers and Sellers, the Corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions that converted the Temple of God, Mans Heart, into a Den of Thieves and Murderers, and thus imbitters all his delicious Luſts, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graces and deſtroys his falſe and deluſory Carnal Joys, (which muſt certainly be done either on Earth or in Hell) then does he feel a neceſſity laid upon him to enquire after another Balſom, to heal his broken Heart and Hopes, than that which grows in his own Garden, and for a ſecure Relief, is conſtrain'd to make towards Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven.</p>
            <p>Yet his purſuits admit of great varieties ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Vigour and Power of that Light which arraigns him, and the Conduct of thoſe different Guides he relies upon, one of the firſt Effects of theſe Convictions, being <hi>Self-diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence.</hi> Some therefore into whoſe Souls the Dart is not ſtruck home and deep enough, yet feel ſome Pain and Smart, and are diſeaſed with and impatient of it, muſt and will have Eaſe, making that their principal Care and End, without any due Endeavours to proceed
<pb facs="tcp:100687:3"/>in a regular Method to gain it: <hi>Therefore Ignorance and Appetite being their Lead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, they in this dark Night ſoon get to Bed, and dream themſelves into a pretty Paradiſe.</hi> Theſe poſſeſs <hi>Peace</hi> without its Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>binger, true <hi>Penitence;</hi> and therefore muſt be more ſadly diſpoſſeſs'd of it, than they ſweetly enjoy it, Impoſtorous Pleaſures never being Permanent. Others with more Art but as lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle Strength, make toward the ſame Port by another Wind, frighted into ſomething like <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance</hi> and <hi>Faith,</hi> and other Parts of <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,</hi> by the Terrors of the <hi>Almighty,</hi> as knowing theſe the only Line and Courſe to bring them to the Haven of Reſt: Yet will not lay on Sail enough, nor exactly direct upon the right Point, but having a ſlothful Heart and Hand, and a ſiniſter Aim, they Anchor upon the Quick-ſands of their own fleeting, fading Formalities and Mockſhews of Religiouſneſs, as a ſufficient Ground and Bottom to ſtay and ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle their Peace upon, yet at length under fair Hopes, and in a Serene Calm, ſink and are ſwallowed up of Everlaſting Woes.</p>
            <p>The Deſign of this Diſcourſe is to prevail with theſe, and all, by the noble Magnetiſm of a thing ſo deſirable-and delightful as true and ſolid Conſolation to engage in real Goodneſs,
<pb facs="tcp:100687:4"/>which is the only way thereto, it being as im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible for Wickedneſs and ſound content of Mind to cohabit, as for Light and Darkneſs; before this therefore would I lay the greateſt Diſcouragements, as there is juſt reaſon, whilſt I attempt to promote the other, which is mainly in my Eye throughout.</p>
            <p>A ſmall Canton of this Tract was, upon pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe to be Tranſcribed, at the requeſt of a Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon grievouſly afflicted with horrid <hi>Injections</hi> (I call them rather than <hi>Spontaneous Cogi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations)</hi> relating to <hi>God</hi> and <hi>Providence;</hi> which whilſt in Hand, my Family was dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh'd by the Death of a Lovely Child, this en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larged my Meditations. Concurrent with theſe was a Report, that if I continued in an obſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate refuſal (as I long had done) to appear in Print, ſome Sermons taken from me in Short<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hand would unknown to me croud into the World, wherein perhaps we both might ſuffer. To prevent this I undertook to ſtop a Gap with this little Piece, and commit it to the publick Cenſure and Conſcience: Only two parcels of it were delivered to an Auditory, in the reſt I took the liberty of a Writer rather than a Preacher. If any thing here ſeem above the Capacity of the Vulgar, yet the greateſt part is not. I endeavoured to ſuit thoſe for whoſe ſake
<pb facs="tcp:100687:4"/>'twas Publiſh'd ſo, that it might not altogether nauſeate the Learned and Ingenious of my Hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers and Readers by an inſipid flatneſs of Stile, or emptineſs of Matter, nor ſoar aloft out of the reach of the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nlearned and Plain. I would ſpeak Things,<note place="margin">Id agendum ut non verbis ſervi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amus, ſed ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus, <hi>Senec. Ep.</hi> 9.</note> not mere Words and Wind, and with ſolidity of Sence Profit, rather than pleaſe with variety of Phra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes: If I miſs of my aim 'tis not the fault of my Subject but Intellect, which in the greateſt depths of matter, I always find extreme ſhallow of Apprehenſion, skinning over things rather than diving into them. And this is that piece of pride that hath hitherto up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held my Averſation to the Preſs, in a fear to betray my Weakneſs. But then again I am too proud willingly to be deem'd and doom'd for a Fool in that of <hi>Seneca,</hi>

            <head>Some ſhort <hi>REMARKS</hi> upon the Author.</head>
            <p>MR. <hi>Thomas Sharp</hi> was Born in <hi>Lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle Horton,</hi> near <hi>Bradford,</hi> in <hi>York<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhire,</hi> of Religious Parents, who ſeeing his Promptneſs and Induſtry for at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining Humane Learning, and hopefulneſs for Religion, dedicated him to God in the Work of the Miniſtry, though he was their eldeſt Son, and likely to enjoy a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable Eſtate: Having made good Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiency in Country Schools, he was ſent up to <hi>Cambridge</hi> about the Year 1649. or 1650. admitted in <hi>Clare-Hall</hi> under the tuition of the famous Mr. <hi>David Clarkſon,</hi> his Mother's Brother, who when he left the Univerſity, committed him to the care of Mr. <hi>John Tillotſon</hi> that great Man, after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards Arch-biſhop of <hi>Canterbury;</hi> where he was very Studious and became an excellent Scholar, having a capacious Soul, of admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Natural Parts, which being cultiva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by External Advantages, and his own more than ordinary Induſtry, he became an <hi>univerſal Scholar,</hi> comprehending the
<pb facs="tcp:100687:6"/>whole <hi>Encyclopaedia</hi> of all profitable Litera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, a ſolid <hi>Logician,</hi> a good <hi>Linguiſt,</hi> a fluent <hi>Rhetorician,</hi> a profound <hi>Philoſopher,</hi> and very skilful in the <hi>Mathematicks.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Being thus well accompliſhed for Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and Parts, after he had taken his De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees in the Univerſity, the firſt Eſſay he made upon the Publick Stage was about <hi>Peterborough,</hi> where ſtaying but a little ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, he came into his Native Country a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the Year 1660. and his Uncle Mr. <hi>Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liam Clarkſon,</hi> who was Parſon of <hi>Add-hill</hi> dying, he was preſented to that Parſonage by Eſq; <hi>Arthington</hi> of <hi>Arthington</hi> the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tron, he accepted of it, but enjoyed it but a little ſpace, for Dr. <hi>Hich,</hi> Parſon of <hi>Guiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley,</hi> challenged it as his by right, upon <hi>King Charles</hi> the Seconds Return, having been excluded by the Act againſt <hi>Pluralities</hi> made by the Parliament; Mr. <hi>Sharp</hi> was capable of it, having been Ordain'd by a Biſhop, yet he ſaw there was no conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding with ſo great a Man, eſpecially in that juncture, he was willing to reſign, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though Mr. <hi>Arthington</hi> would have tryed his Title to preſent by Law, but he decli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned it, (for at that time he ſaw a Cloud approaching with covered us all) and ſo retired to his Father's Houſe, where he was
<pb facs="tcp:100687:6"/>of ſingular uſe, living privately, and fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing his Studies very cloſe, attending upon Publick Ordinances in the Pariſh Church at <hi>Bradford,</hi> where that worthy Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon Mr. <hi>Abraham Brooksbank</hi> was Vicar till he removed to <hi>Reading.</hi> But when the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cences (granted by <hi>King Charles</hi> 2. in 72.) came forth, he took the opportunity to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe his Miniſtry in his own Houſe, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing crowded with great numbers that flock'd to hear him. About that time he married Mrs. <hi>Bagnall</hi>'s Daughter, by whom he had one Daughter, but both dyed. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter a ſeaſon he married Mr. <hi>Sales</hi> Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, (an excellent <hi>N. C.</hi> Miniſter) by whom he had ſeveral Children, but none are now living, but one Son and one Daughter.</p>
            <p>He had a call to Preach at <hi>Morley,</hi> where he was very induſtrious and highly eſteem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. But the Inhabitants of that populous Town of <hi>Leeds</hi> (having built a large Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel) upon Mr. <hi>Richard Streattons</hi> remove to <hi>London,</hi> gave him a call which he em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braced, living at his own Houſe at <hi>Horton,</hi> riding moſtly on <hi>Lords day</hi> Morning to <hi>Leeds,</hi> and back again at Evening (in Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer time at leaſt) which was above a do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zen Miles, and Preaching twice, which at length he found too hard for him, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb facs="tcp:100687:7"/>he bought a Houſe in <hi>Leeds,</hi> repaired it, built to it, and kept Houſe there and at <hi>Horton</hi> alſo, where his neceſſary affairs requir'd his frequent attendance.</p>
            <p>He was in Labours more abundant and ſpared not his own Body or Eſtate, that he might do good to Souls, and edifie the Church of God: He was very ſelf-denying, and ſtood not upon Worldly Incomes, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they were more or leſs he was very well content, ſo that he gave ſtrict charge to thoſe who collected that ſmall Pittance he accepted of in conſideration of his La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, not to urge any, but only receive the voluntary Contributions of thoſe who were as well able as willing: He was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding Temperate; mortified to all Earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Enjoyments; of great Aequanimity, So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciable to all, yet prized above all others, ſuch as feared God, theſe were his choſen Companions: He invited Miniſters and Chriſtian Friends frequently to days of Faſting and Prayer in his own Houſe, and went upon a call abroad upon thoſe Occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions: He was indeed very excellent in Prayer, and had a peculiar way of plead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with God, by ſerious ſenſible Expoſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations with great Ardency and Affection, which made it appear to Intelligent Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,
<pb facs="tcp:100687:7"/>that he was much with God in Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yer, and very familiar with him, few had thoſe rare Gifts, or exerciſed Grace at that rate; and no doubt God dealt familiarly with his Soul; he lived near God, and now is with his God: His Prayers were uſually long but not tedious, being flowered with variety of ſweet Expreſſions, and Patheti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Expoſtulations; and I doubt not but the Lord graciouſly accepted his Perſon, and vouchſafed many gracious Anſwers to his ardent Prayers, as might appear in ſeveral Inſtances, which I forbear to mention.</p>
            <p>He was a fluent Preacher, a Maſter of Words, not ſo much abounding in Rheto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rical Flouriſhes, as in Pithy and Profitable Sentences, very taking with his Auditors, that fit under his Miniſtry with great de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light: His Sermons were Elaborate and Accurate, all he did was exceeding Polite and Scholar-like; his Method was peculiar to himſelf, and ſometimes Cryptical, but always ſuitable to the matter, and proper to the end deſign'd, not to pleaſe the Fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, but to inform the Judgment, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince the Conſcience, work upon the Will and Affections, and change the Heart and Life. He hath often ſaid he ſhould never have been ſo cautious, and ſo careful of his
<pb facs="tcp:100687:8"/>Words, had not his Father been ſo critical and found ſo many faults with him, which he ſtudied to rectifie, this did him good, though he found it hard to ſtoop to, but as he was ſenſible of his Paternal Authority, and his own Filial Duty; ſo he was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinc'd of his Fathers judicious Exceptions and the tendency thereof to his own Benefit.</p>
            <p>He was very Sound and Orthodox, and trod much in the old Path, though he was well acquainted with the Controverſies of the Times, and very able to oppugne Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror, and defend the Truth; yet he was of a peaceable Spirit, making the beſt Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions of doubtful Phraſes, and incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned rather to compoſe Differences, Civil and Sacred, than to eſpouſe a Party; he was of a Catholick Spirit, and ſpake well of what was good in Perſons that differed from him; he was very unwilling to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage in any Controverſie, only ſome know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his Acuteneſs and Genius deſired his help in three Caſes, firſt againſt the <hi>Papiſts</hi> upon occaſion of a young Man turning that way, and ſending a Letter to his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations, which he anſwered very Learned<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and to great Satisfaction. 2dly. Two Papers he writ in Reply to two Confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſts, who grievouſly and rigidly cenſured
<pb facs="tcp:100687:8"/>their peaceable Brethren, the one in Print, the other in Writing; both which he An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered and Confuted; both well deſerved Publiſhing, but the Times would not then bear it, and now they may ſeem out of ſeaſon, but are ſtill preſerved as choice Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuſcripts in the Hands of Friends: As is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo (3dly.) an Anſwer to ſome Queries, ſuppoſed to be Dr. <hi>Owens, Whether Perſons who have engaged unto Reformation, and ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther way of Divine Worſhip, according to the Word of God,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>may lawfully go unto and attend on the uſe of the</hi> Common Prayer <hi>in Divine Worſhip,</hi> &amp;c.?</p>
            <p>He had a lofty Poetical Strain, wherein he ſometimes (for a diverſion) employed himſelf upon ſpecial Occaſions, as upon the Death of that Worthy Grave Divine Mr. <hi>Elkanah Wales,</hi> and upon the Burning of <hi>London</hi> in 1666. which being ſhow'd to Dr. <hi>Robert Wild,</hi> he ſeem'd ſurpriz'd, and ingenuouſly acknowledg'd, <hi>that Man ſhould be his Maſter, he would yeild the Laurel to the North Country Poet.</hi> An imperfect Copy of his <hi>Verſes</hi> for and againſt <hi>Sleep</hi> (made in his younger Years, when at the Univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity) were Printed under the Name of the Famous <hi>Cleveland;</hi> ſeveral other of his <hi>Poems,</hi> deſervedly valuable, remain in the Cuſtody of ſome Friends.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:100687:9"/>
            <p> He had a copious Library, and abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of the chocieſt Books, of which he made good uſe, having a notable facility in turning over <hi>Authors,</hi> and picking the Quinteſſence out of them.</p>
            <p>He would never be perſwaded to put any thing to the Preſs, though often ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licited to Print ſomething, but reply'd there were Books enough Printed: But a Gentlewoman in the Neighbourhood being in great trouble of Conſcience, often came to viſit him; whilſt he diſcours'd with her, ſhe ſeem'd to be much ſatisfied, and her Spirit appeaſed, but when ſhe was gone from him ſhe was as much caſt down and diſconſolate as ever; whereupon ſhe ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly deſired him to write down ſome Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent Meditations, that ſhe might have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe to, when ſhe was abſent from him; which he did, and gives ſome account of in his Epiſtle to the Reader, perfixed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore this enſuing Treatiſe, yet could not be perſwaded to let it ſee the Light while he lived, yet ſhewed ſome willingneſs it ſhould be Printed after his deceaſe, having before writ it out by his own Hand in readineſs for the Preſs, and deſign'd for Publick Good; which upon the Importunity and Encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement of ſeveral Friends is now accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſh'd
<pb facs="tcp:100687:9"/>by his ſurviving Widow, that all the Voluminous Labours of ſuch a wiſe Maſter-builder might not be loſt, ſince moſt of his Writings for his own uſe were in Short-hand, and not fully Legible or In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligible by any, there being many un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known Characters of his own inventing interſperſed.</p>
            <p>But to come to the laſt Scene of this worthy Man's Life: He had endured the acute pains of the Pleuriſie four ſeveral times, yet through the Bleſſing of God as often recovered out of it, though upon fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent occaſions complaining of a pain in his ſide, yet by Temperance and the uſe of Means, he was wonderfully ſhored up in the midſt of his Travels, Studies, and Preachings.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Auguſt</hi> the <hi>4th.</hi> 1693. he rid from his own Houſe at <hi>Horton</hi> to <hi>Leeds,</hi> being as well as ordinarily, in competent Health, Preached that day, being <hi>Friday,</hi> the Prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration Sermon for the <hi>Lord's Supper: Lord's<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day Auguſt</hi> the <hi>6th.</hi> he Preached twice. Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtred the <hi>Lord's Supper,</hi> was won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfully enlarged both in Expreſſions and warm Affections, ſo that ſome were ready to think he was in Heaven already, and
<pb facs="tcp:100687:10"/>admired the Grace of God in him.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Wedneſday, Auguſt 9th.</hi> was the Month<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Publick Faſt, he was long at Work, ſpent himſelf exceedingly: On <hi>Thurſday</hi> Night he begun of his old Diſtemper the Pleuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie, which now made the fifth vigorous Aſſault; he was by the Phyſicians advice Blooded twice, but his Diſtemper prevail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and turned rather to a Fever, yet ſtill the violent Pain in his ſide continued, but he was very ſenſible and patient under it: <hi>Auguſt 24th.</hi> he deſired the aſſiſtance of a Friend in drawing his Will, which he Subſcribed the <hi>26th.</hi> after that he made a moſt Pathetical affecting Exhortation to ſeveral Chriſtian Friends then preſent, who obſerved that the Graces of Faith and Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility, which had been eminent through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the whole courſe of his Life did grow and encreaſe to the very laſt; he was no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in his own Eyes, had the moſt ſelf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>debaſing Expreſſions imaginable; <q>Poor Creature, ſinful Worm, vile Wretch, that had intruded into the high calling of the Miniſtry, and had no Gifts, no Graces, no Abilities, to diſcharge ſuch a Truſt.</q> He even loathed himſelf for it, and if the Great God ſhould ſpurn him out of his Preſence he could not but juſtifie him:
<pb facs="tcp:100687:10"/>
               <q>Oh! wo is me that I have ſinned, I even tremble to appear before the dreadful Tribunal of God, who will come with flaming Fire to take vengeance on them that know not God, and obey not the Goſpel of our <hi>Lord Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> Remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber what I preach'd to you from that Text; I have endeavour'd to diſcharge a good Conſcience, though with a mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude of Imperfections, and have not ſhunned to declare unto you the whole Counſel of God, and I bleſs God for the ſweet Communion I have had with you in his Ordinances, and humbly beſeech him to ſupply the breach that is ſhortly to be made, and to ſend you a Man of Judgment, fitted with his Spirit, that may better diſcharge his Duty than I have done, who deſerve to be made a Spectacle of Miſery to Angels and Men; But bleſſed be God for hopes of Salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on through the Bleſſed Mediator <hi>Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> Oh the infinite Riches of free Grace!</q> And here he fell into an holy extaſie of Joy, but the Expreſſions cannot be retriev'd, thoſe who were preſent being too deeply Affected to take the Particulars in Writing or Memory. Several In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions likewiſe he gave to his Relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. The Night after he grew very weak
<pb facs="tcp:100687:11"/>and his Vital Spirits decay'd more and more, till the next Morning about Seven of the Clock, having taken a ſolemn leave of his dear Wife and Children, and with great Faith and Chearfulneſs recommended his Soul into the Hands of his dear Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer, he encountred the Pangs of Death <hi>Auguſt</hi> the <hi>27th.</hi> 1693. being <hi>Lord's-day,</hi> and entred upon his Everlaſting Reſt, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing aged Sixty Years.</p>
            <p>On <hi>Tueſday Auguſt</hi> the <hi>29th.</hi> he was Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried, many ſad and ſorrowful Hearts, both of Miniſters and Chriſtian Friends atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the Funeral. His Corpſe was ſolemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Interred in the Chancel of the New Church in <hi>Leeds,</hi> nigh the Remains of good Mr. <hi>Wales,</hi> as himſelf had deſired.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>September</hi> the <hi>6th.</hi> 1693. upon the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples requeſt, two of his Brethren Preached Funeral Sermons at his Meeting-place on <hi>Mill-Hill,</hi> to a mighty concourſe of Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, the one treating upon <hi>Acts</hi> 20.38. <hi>Sorrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing moſt of all for the Words which he ſpake that they ſhould ſee his Face no more.</hi> The other trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted upon that Text, 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 13.30. <hi>And he laid his Carkaſe in his own Grave, and they mourned over him, ſaying, alas my Brother!</hi>
            </p>
            <pb facs="tcp:100687:11"/>
            <p> Thus dyed this holy Man of God, that hath left few behind him of the ſame Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, a Dutiful Child to his godly Parents, a Loving Husband to his lovely Wife, an Indulgent Father to his hopeful Children, a Faithful Friend to all that feared God, a Conſciencious, Laborious Miniſter, and Tender-hearted Watchman over the Souls of his Flock. A Perſon of great worth in all Men's account but his own; indeed it was ſtrange to ſee a Man of ſuch eminent Parts, and rare, and raiſed Accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, to have ſo mean an eſteem of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf; he thought himſelf below others, though he was higher by Head and Shoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders than moſt of his Brethren: He was cloathed with Humility, this was the up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Garment, put upon all his other Graces, and was his braveſt Ornament, which ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred him Conſpicuous in the Eyes of all that knew him: Though much more might be ſaid of him, yet let his own Works Praiſe him in the Gates, and let us all make ſure of our State, and make haſt after him to that Land of Light, that New <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It cannot be expected that a Compleat Draught of this worthy Man's Life ſhould be drawn by any Pencil but his own.
<pb facs="tcp:100687:12"/>May theſe hints of ſo rare a Patern of Pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, have influence upon his ſurviving Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations and Hearers, to transform them in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the ſame Image, that this Legacy of ſo Rational a Diſcourſe, may have a perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive Power to attract Souls to a Capacity for Divine Conſolations; and ſuch a real Example have a compulſive Power to draw many to follow this <hi>Heroe</hi> and others into <hi>Eternal Manſions;</hi> if both do not effect theſe Ends, the Spectator and Reader have more to Anſwer for.</p>

The inanimate Creatures may indeed be diſpoſſeſt of their Heaven, <hi>viz.</hi> their Centre and Reſt; but the Evil thereof they can neither fear nor feel. Vegetables may live in a Hell through the burning Fever of a Summer's drought, but can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ſmart and be in pain. Senſitive Natures may be farther diveſted of their Happineſs, be driven out of their Paradiſe in <hi>Gilead</hi> and <hi>Baſhan,</hi> and be yet more miſerable under the Servitude of that torturing Devil, the Luſt of degenerate man; but a final period is put to all their Infelicities by that, which (if infinite Grace prevent not) will be only the beginning of our remedileſs Woe; at the worſt they can but die, and 'tis without the ſting of a cruciating Fear, that a Life without end, after Death will introduce a Series of never-ending Plagues. But Immortality, the higheſt Preroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive of humane Nature, is through Sin become its moſt diſmal cauſe of horrour, and in being better than the reſt of the inferiour Creation, we through our own default are only render'd capable of being worſe, both in another, and even in this preſent life, as far as our dreadful Expectations become prolepſis or pre-occupation of thoſe Sufferings, which are no leſs durable than intolerable. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther can we be eas'd by the hopes, that the leaſt part or degree hereof is avoidable through the effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacy of our home-bred endowments, or any thing
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:100687:13" rendition="simple:additions"/>we can ſcrape out of the rubbiſh of collapſed Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, ſince by experience we find, that our greateſt preventive care is not able totally to exclude and keep down thoſe prepoſſeſſing horrible anticipa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; nor the Furniture we are enrich'd with, of power to ſupport and eaſe our minds under (much leſs to antidote) thoſe real Plagues, which actually infeſt, and ſink us towards a State much more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſupportable, our hope and help muſt needs there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore periſh from within, our relief is wholly from without; yet not from Earth, but Heaven. There's no Malady ſo perplexing, ſo dangerous, but there's a ſufficient and ſuitable Remedy in God.</p>
               <p>In <hi>Bedlam</hi> I have ſeen a Man under the Severity of that moſt rigid and moſt uncomfortable Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finement, ſo not only unconcern'd but triumphant, as to bear up himſelf in the Port and Majeſty of a King, and in his imaginary height and glory, with a diſdainful ſtatelineſs, converſe with thoſe little ſhreds of Mortality who were bleſt, as he thought, in the Honour of his Empire and Government; and ſometimes with a ſtately humbleneſs invite them to glory in his Condeſcenſions; with ſuch a creative power is Fancy endow'd, that it can pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce almoſt any thing out of nothing, dwindle ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantial Woes into Shadows, convert a Hell into an <hi>Elyſium.</hi> Of ſuch Madmen the World is full: We (as the Priſoners of Juſtice) carry our Chains about with us, and they ſit and ſink into our Fleſh, yea, our very bones; yet, as if we poſſeſt an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>confinable liberty, we jovially dance about, and ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace our ſelves with this lamentable dream, till our real Miſeries confute our falſe Imaginations. For a Man's ſtate may be miſerable, yet the Man ſo ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionally, ſtoically, or brutiſhly mad, as not to be miſerable: That is, ſince nothing can make a Man
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:100687:14" rendition="simple:additions"/>unhappy but by the mediation of ſomething with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in him, his Fancy, his Folly, his Fears, his Feeling, his Reaſonable Powers; hence that which a Man either is above the ſence of, or hath no ſenſe of, is to him as if it were not, though never ſo real in it ſelf: Therefore the Venom and Sting of Infelicity is our Senſe, and the Gall and Bitterneſs of our Senſe lies in our Thoughts, the workings of our Minds. A Man that lies aſleep bound hand and foot upon the top of a Precipice, with his Head, and a great part of his Body hanging over a bottomleſs Gulf, is in a caſe moſt wretched in it ſelf, the leaſt hitch tumbles him down into remedileſs Ruine; yet in the condition he is in, <hi>viz.</hi> Sleeping, he is aware of no danger, to him all's well and ſecure, he has no apprehenſions except of Eaſe, Safety, and Reſt. But awake him that he look about, ſee feel, and think of his Peril and Helpleſsneſs, then will he be all Agony and Horror, ready to ſwoon and die through the direful Apprehenſions of his (as to himſelf) ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remediable Death. This is our Caſe, we are na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally aſleep in Security and Iniquity; upon the brinks of Hell, bound hand and foot in the Chains of our Sins, and an Adverſary, Satan, at hand, to puſh us headlong into the Abyſs of Miſery. Beſide, the Omnipotent Vengeance of Heaven awaits us ready to arraign, condemn, and execute us, to which we even dare it every moment. But being aſleep (nay, dead, <hi>Eph.</hi> 2.1.) we feel nothing; reck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs and careleſs, in a <hi>Bedlam</hi> Dream, we conceit that we ſwim upon a ſmooth and Halcyon Sea of ſenſual Joys, as if 'twere a Voyage to Paradiſe, 'till God awake us by the Calls and Convictions of his Word and Spirit; but then, Oh, the inexpreſſible Troubles, Terrors and Aſtoniſhment that arreſt us! becauſe our amazing Jeopardy, whereof we
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:100687:14"/>had no apprehenſions before, is now entertain'd into our Thoughts, and works ſo much the more violently there, by how much we find our ſelves the more helpleſs, and therefore hopeleſs. Thus, whatever perplexes us, does it by way of Thoughts, as it inveſts our Mind and Conſideration, it tortures us. 'Till it thus get within us, and engage our conſidering Faculties, it does not or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarily commit a Rape upon our Iraſcible, or Interrupt the Sweet and Peace of a ſecure and quiet Compoſure and Reſt. But when this Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peſt, this Hurricane of Thoughts beats upon us, we cannot tell which way to turn, how to bear up againſt it. It confounds our Reaſon, diſcom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes our Affections, terrifies our Conſciences, tears down all our Confidences, reduces us to an abſolute <hi>Nonplus.</hi> Our Thoughts trouble us (as <hi>Dan.</hi> 4.19.) even to aſtoniſhment, and ſo much the more, by how many the more they are. <hi>Multitudes</hi> of Thoughts beget multitudes of Cares and Fears, and Griefs and Cumbers, and Diſqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ets and Deſpondencies; and of theſe ſo many the more, by how much the more intimate and deep within, and by how much the more they are our own, not of a divine Injection, but a corrupt Mind's Fabrication.</p>

And if they be penetra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting Thoughts, that ſink and ſoak into the bottom, and become moſt <hi>intimate</hi> within me, not lying ſhallow upon the furface of my Soul; <hi>In ſuch mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titudes of my thoughts within me,</hi> I cannot find the leaſt glimmering of Comfort at home, nothing but Terror and Deſpair; conſtrain'd am I there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to look abroad, and no where can I enjoy any thing reviving,<note place="margin">Refer to the 1.

And ſince nothing can paſs into my Soul, but at the door of Thoughts, even theſe thy Comforts cannot affect me, but as Troubles do, they muſt enter into my Thoughts too, be apprehended by my Mind, ere they can relieve my Heart. The ſame Engine that intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced my Miſery, muſt uſher in my Mercy. I muſt be cured through the ſame Weapon that wounded me. <hi>Thoughts,</hi> the firſt born of my Soul, muſt bear my Comforts that heal me; the healing is not from any vertue in the Weapon, but thy <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts,</hi> the Salve upon it. <hi>My Soul</hi> by its Thoughts viewing thy <hi>Comforts</hi> and tranſmitting them to my Affections is in a tranſport of delight and joy.</p>
               <p>The Word rendered <hi>Thoughts</hi> is but twice found in Scripture. Interpreters judge from the affinity
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:100687:15"/>of it with other Words of the ſame ſound and almoſt the ſame Letters, that it carries an alluſion to the Boughs of a Tree. <hi>Such Thoughts</hi> then are here to be underſtood, which in like manner pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding from the Mind of Man ſpread every way, and divide into ſmaller Branches, and the ſmalleſt Twigs, ſo entangling themſelves together as upon every motion to wound each other, and the Tree they ſpring from.

The Original does not intimate ſo much the Act as the Power and Poſſibility of delighting; not that the Pſalmiſt did actually lay hold upon, embrace, and apply to himſelf, but only that thoſe Comforts of God did rather manifeſt a forwardneſs, and favorable readineſs, to lay hold upon him; they were not already apprehended by him, but offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed themſelves to him, lay plain and fair before him, inviting him by their benign and amiable looks, by their goodneſs, and ſweetneſs, and ſui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tableneſs to cloſe with, and eſpouſe them. Even then when we are ſo overwhelmed with Perplexi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and Troubles that we do not, or will not, or cannot, or dare not appropriate divine Comforts to our ſelves; they notwithſtanding are prepared for

               <p>But now the Perſonal Character of the Penman of this Pſalm, I cannot give except I could cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly find who it was.

If Thoughts of God will not work one way, they will not another. That Man's Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts are none of God's, which are not uſher'd in by the Fear of God; neither has he any Right to receive Good from any thing of God, who is not wrought and formed into Goodneſs by All of him; God will be all or nothing; command down our Corruptions by the dread of his Power, or he will not command up our Content by the diſplay of his Kindneſs; if he cannot bend us, he will break us. The ſenſe of his Glory muſt make us better, or the ſenſe of his Bounty muſt not make our burthen lighter. In ſum, Greatneſs muſt awe us, or Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs ſhall not eaſe us; no ſenſe of God can do us good that is not univerſal. No Promiſes comfort, independently upon the Precepts. We ſteal our Peace, if Grace give it not. And holy Senſations
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:100687:19" rendition="simple:additions"/>of the plenitude of all heart and life-ruling Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lencies in God, are the very firſt Principles and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginnings of Grace.

The Origin of this, both Preſumption and Diſobedience, is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clar'd, <hi>ver.</hi> 21. <hi>Thou thoughteſt that I was altogether ſuch a one as thy ſelf:</hi> Low, creeping, ineffectual Thoughts of God, which will permit Men to be unlike God, will alſo ſuffer them to delude them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves into real Woe, by invading his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts without the Warrant of his Commands. He that hath a Right to ſolace himſelf in God, or any thing of his, muſt in his proportion be like God. 'Tis in virtue of his infinite Perfection, that he is infinitely pleaſed with himſelf; if we poſſeſs nothing of the one, both as a foreign Good, and domeſtick perſonal Qualification, what have we to do with the other? If the Perfections of God be not our objective chief Happineſs without us; if they be not a transforming Principle and Life with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in us, as far as communicable, they cannot be our Formal chief Good and Happineſs: If they be not our Right and Nature, they cannot be our Pleaſure. There can be no Satisfaction whilſt there is Diſſimilitude, Diſſenſion, Oppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Natures. What Comfort can Enemies have one in another? A harmony of Diſpoſitions muſt introduce Complacency; where this is not, there's no Content. All that ſolaces, muſt be ſui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table. Pleaſure and Delight ariſe from the agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ableneſs of Objects and Appetites. What pleaſes
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:100687:19"/>not, comforts not. God himſelf, who is an ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting Fullneſs and Fountain of the ſweeteſt and richeſt Satisfactions, cannot be a comfort to that Soul, which is not pleaſed with him; and then no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in the World can; it being impoſſible that finite ſhould outdo infinite. But how can that Man be pleaſed with God, that does not appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend his ſingularly delectable Excellencies, or ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehending them, does not by conſideration work a due reſpect to them into his inmoſt Soul, ſo as out of Conſcience, with a liberal and ingenuous Affection, to approve of, and chuſe, and acqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſce in God, as his All-ſufficient Portion, his ſole and ſupreme Felicity? Really if we think that we can be, and enjoy better any where elſe than in God, or if that be the import of our Actions, we neither can nor will poſſeſs a Heaven of Conſola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in God. For that only is our ultimate Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, which is our beſt, and if we do but make God a means to a further end, he cannot be our reſt. Here then muſt we fix our Tabernacles for a final repoſe and content; therefore muſt keep a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>live, and lively in our Minds and Hearts the Thoughts of God. He that can live a day with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſome pleaſing Reflections upon immenſe Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, Power, Holineſs, Juſtice, Goodneſs, Faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs, All-ſufficiency, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> may be a Devil to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morrow, as he is a Beaſt to day; but Title has he none whilſt thus brutiſh, to refreſh himſelf with the Comforts of Heaven, ſince he owns not the Well-ſpring of them. Oh, let us ſet the Lord al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways before our eyes, and keep him in view as the Omniſcient Superviſor of our hearts and ways, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving always an eye within us, piercing into the moſt ſecret receſſes of our Souls. Let only a <hi>Balaam</hi> ſay in the future, <hi>I ſhall behold him, but not near;</hi> do
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:100687:20"/>thou, O my Soul, awe thy ſelf into ſeriouſneſs, and Integrity of Conſcience, by preſent Conſideration, that this all-comprehending, unconfinable Nature, is neceſſarily more nigh to, and intimately preſent with thee, than any thing in the World, thine own Body, nay, thy very Thoughts, and moſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Motions not excepted. Thou underſtandeſt that he is the higheſt Perfection, and plenitude of Eſſence, Exiſtence, Subſtance, Glory; that more of God is every where, than of any thing; that there is not ſo much Soul in a body, Light in the Sun, Matter in the Univerſe, as there is of God in each; that they are not, as he is. They are but derivative Beings of a thin, lank Conſtitution, in compariſon of that amplitude and fullneſs of Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in God, who is every thing in the utmoſt Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, that he can poſſible be, from Eternity to Eternity unalterable, and every where the ſame boundleſs Perfection, that he is any where. And wilt thou dare to be, or ſpeak, or do any thing unbecoming ſo auguſt, ſo awful, ſo glorious a Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence. Shall the eye of a Worm, <hi>Job</hi> 25.6. give Law to thy Tongue and Hands, and ſhall not the Sovereign Majeſty of Heaven and Earth have an Empire in thy Conſcience? Oh, do not dare to be other now, than at Judgment thou wilt wiſh thou hadſt been: For thy Judge is no leſs preſent, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though thou be leſs ſenſible. Enforce upon thy ſelf, nay, rather with a ſpontaneous and generous Freedom of Spirit, out of choice entertain, and take complacency in ſuch Conſiderations alway, as may better thee, becauſe not to be better for them is to be worſe; ineffectual Thoughts of God being like to be effectual for thy confuſion. If the Rays of Divine Glory that ſhine into thy reaſoning Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, have no influence upon thy Appetite and

THe Sacred Penman here was a Man of <hi>Prayer,</hi> the whole Pſalm is a ſolemn Addreſs to God; and 'tis not like the fumbling of one unaccuſtomed thus to converſe with the Divine Majeſty; the Genius of it gives abundant evidence that it hath been a familiar and frequent practice with ſuch gravity of Expreſſion, with ſuch liberty of Spirit, with ſuch a holy Parrheſy and Confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, with ſuch variety of Arguments, with ſuch endearments of affection does he plead with God, as one that long had liv'd upon the trade, and was a good Proficient in this heavenly art of Wreſtling with God. And indeed 'tis generally under this Duty, that the Lord adminiſters the ſolace and
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:100687:21"/>ſatisfaction of his Love to revive a drooping Heart. Whoever is unacquainted with Prayer, is ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly an alien from Divine Peace. Thoſe that live moſt with God in this exerciſe, receive moſt from God, enjoy moſt in him, to ſweeten their Spirits, under all their Sorrows; his Promiſe engaging him to be found in a way of Peace and Contentation, of all thoſe that diligently ſeek him. Beſide that his own Glory engages him to anſwer the Petitions of Peace which are put up in the Name, and put into the Hands of his only Begotten, to be preſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to his Majeſty, perfumed with the Incenſe of his Mediation, <hi>Joh.</hi> 14.13. <hi>Whatever ye ſhall ask in my Name that will I do.</hi> Wherefore? is it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe you ask, or for the merit of your Devotions, or the ſtrength of your Faith, or the fervency of of your Spirits, or the forcibleneſs of your Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments, or the urgency of your Importunities, <hi>&amp;c.?

Indeed this Heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Dove comes only in at the Window of Prayer; but we muſt put forth our hand to take it, and heartily, humbly, believingly to beg it, is as little as we can do; if we ſluggiſhly put our hand into our Boſom, and refuſe this labour, we together with it reject the Olive Branch of Peace: But who in his wits would not beg with all manner of Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yer, <hi>Publick, Private, Secret, Mental, Vocal,</hi> with a Form, without, when he may be aſſured if he ask to receive, that his Joy may be full, <hi>Joh.</hi> 16.24. This 94th <hi>Pſalm</hi> and the reſt, moſt of them ſeem in their compoſure to be deſign'd by the Penmen for Privacy, though God had a further deſign in them, <hi>viz.</hi> to make them Publick, and part of the Canon of Scripture, for the guidance of his Church in all Ages; and aſſuredly, he is a ſtranger to heavenly Comforts, who is a ſtranger to ſecret Converſes and Communion with God. 'Tis true, God by bringing theſe ſecret breathings of holy Souls after himſelf, in theſe <hi>Pſalms</hi> to a more pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick uſe, and making their private Forms of Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yer as it were the common Liturgy of his Church in all Generations, may ſeem graciouſly to intend the honour of his publick Worſhip by the Church, ſince he hath pickt out that for Catholick advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage, which in reality was a Treaſure in all their private Devotions, pretermitting the reſt. For that more were compoſed by them, I no more doubt than that other Books were made by <hi>Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon,</hi> beſides thoſe preſerv'd in the Holy Writings. And that Forms of Humane Compoſure, as well as
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:100687:22"/>Divine Inſpiration, were made uſe of by holy Souls, without impeach of any crime therein; particularly without the guilt of Idolatry, (the ſenſleſs ſottiſh charge of ſome againſt a Form) is demonſtrable from the <hi>New Teſtament,</hi> where Chriſts Diſciples beſeech him to teach them to pray as the <hi>Phariſees</hi> and <hi>John</hi> taught theirs. They taught them Forms and ſo did he; theirs Humane, his Divine. But if this were ſo foul a crime, ſo odi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to God, would he (who is ſo ſevere againſt Phariſes upon other occaſions, even in relation to their Prayers) give it the honour of an approving I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitation, and not rather chaſtize it with the Scor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pions of a bitter rigorous reproof, and check his Diſciples deſire to be Idolaters, or ſymbolize with them? I could demonſtrate irrefragably, that this whimzy would abſolutely turn all Vocal Prayer whatever out of the Church, if it were as true as it is abominably falſe; but this is no place for it.</p>
               <p>The choice which God made for the Church of theſe more refined ſuſpirations of pure and heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Souls, that in a zealous ardour of divine and raiſed affection, lifted up themſelves towards his holy Habitation, in theſe Forms of his own dicta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting and directing by his holy Spirit, and his ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying them to publick uſe, are a teſtimony that he accounts the honour of more to be more ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, and his reſerving the beſt for the Church, when others are loſt, declares, that he expects the beſt from it. His own is to him always moſt ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable, and adminiſtring hereof to his Church, to offer before him, he evidences that he would have its Offerings to be always acceptable, and in this proviſion he gives the Publick a preference to any thing perſonal, which alſo he further ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vances by making theſe publick Miniſtrations the
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:100687:23"/>ordinary means to beget ſpiritual Life, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Peace. But then nevertheleſs, the benefit of that which we enjoy in Publick, depends upon what we are in Private; and the main buſineſs of Church Offices and Ordinances, is to make us in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly and ſecretly ſound and ſolid Chriſtians For God no more regards outward publick Sem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blances, without Sincerity, than a whited Sepul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chre; his general end is to make us upright <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thanaels, Iſraelites</hi> indeed in whom there is no guile, not gilded <hi>Hypocrites;</hi> and no better are we, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever our viſible Sacrifices may be, if yet we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain our Chambers of Imagery in private, and do not break down the Idols of our Hearts; ſtriving to be inwardly before God, what before Men we ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear to be outwardly; which we ſhall never do, if we take not our Hearts to task in ſecret. Let us blow never ſo many Trumpets before our ſelves, ruffle and brave it as triumphantly as is imaginable, in the phantaſtry of our Silk and Satten Devotion, before Men; yet if our heavenly Father never meet us in a Cloſet, if there we have nothing ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable to preſent him, if we take no pains there to dreſs up our inward Souls for his embraces; la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring to the utmoſt to prepare our Work with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in there, when we deſign to build him a publick Temple, that the ſavour of our more retired Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with God may abide upon our Spirits, and the perfume of that Incenſe, which we offer with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the Veil, may aſcend, and become a viſible Cloud without; if not thus, I am affraid, that at the great reckoning, for all our Trimming and Gallantry, the Crowns and Garlands of our publick Sacrifices, we ſhall ſtand in <hi>querpo,</hi> and be found no better than Phariſees.</p>

               <p> The <hi>Pſalmiſt</hi>'s Prayer was firſt a ſecret ere it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came a publick Application to God. Learn then, Oh my Soul, to begin there, and make it thy firſt and main buſineſs, to approve thy Heart ſecretly, to the Searcher of Hearts; and by Communing with it and God alone, deal effectually with it, that he, who ſees in ſecret, may ſee, that it is in good earneſt. Be much with God in thy Medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions before, that thou mayſt not have thy ſtrag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gling Thoughts to gather up and fix, when thy Affections are to enter into a vigorous purſuit af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Grace and God. See that there be not a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved Luſt within, that would hide it ſelf from the Lord, when thou ſhouldſt make thy unreſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved Acknowledgments. Let not thy Confeſſions be a bare heartleſs enumeration of thy Sins, but the real exerciſe of true Repentance, leaſt they paſs only for ſelf Accuſations, and thine own Mouth produce the Teſtimony againſt thee, which will caſt and condemn thee.

               <p n="2">2. As to the <hi>Coetus Malignantium, ver.</hi> 21. the <hi>Congregation of Condemners;</hi> he forefees an end of their <hi>Proſperity,</hi> the beginning of their <hi>Calamity, ver.</hi> 10. <hi>A Pit digging for them,</hi> ver. 13. and their ſinal Execution, <hi>ver.</hi> 23. Thus we ſee his <hi>Faith;</hi> and I am ready to think that this was the great Inſtrument of his Comfort. Whatever troubles befel he could ſee through them by <hi>Faith.</hi> 'Twas a judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious ſaying of a good Man, That <hi>in all Afflictions and Straits Faith can find an outgate.</hi> This is a real ground of Conſolation. All the Bonds, Chains, Cords of Affliction to Faith are, like <hi>Sampſon</hi>'s, but as a Thread that hath felt the Fire. All the Rage and Malice of Earth and Hell, but like his <hi>Lyon: Faith</hi> can rend them in pieces. 'Tis too hard for them, it can fetch Hony, Comfort out of them. If this Grace can make that preſent which is not yet; realize that which being only in its cauſes is at preſent nothing; then can it take up the comfort of a Bleſſing in the Promiſe, and live upon its ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, as if it were already in Poſſeſſion. There's no diſtinction of times to <hi>Faith:</hi> It enjoys not its objects in ſucceſſion, but at once. Nothing to it is paſt and to come, (though to ſenſe there be) all is preſent and in view, in hand. It ſees with the Eye of God in the Promiſe, and therefore ſees as he ſees. It lives with Chriſt in Heaven, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore lives as he lives, <hi>Gal.</hi> 2.20. It is an endleſs poſſeſſion of Life all at once, as they deſcribe Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Eternity. Oh happy Soul, that is enrich'd with this noble Grace, whereby 'tis endow'd with God and all things: Oh unſpeakable miſery of
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:100687:26"/>thoſe that live (or rather continually die) with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out it. To be in Unbelief is to be in Hell, <hi>i. e.</hi> in ſtate, the place is but a Circumſtance. The ſubſtance of Hell conſiſting in three things, 1. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing under a Sentence of Condemnation and the Curſe, <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.18. <hi>He that believes not is condemn'd already.</hi> 2. Irrecoverable loſs of Happineſs, <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.36. <hi>He that believes not ſhall not ſee Life, i. e.</hi> if he never believe he ſhall never ſee Life Eternal. And 3. Everlaſting ſenſe of Wrath, <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.36. <hi>The wrath of God abides upon him;</hi> does not meerly, as <hi>Ezekiel</hi>'s Flying Roll, paſs over him; but on him it ſettles, and reſts, and dwells, as in its fixed and indefeiſible Inheritance, its proper and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changable Home and Habitation. Ah dolorous State! Ah wretched Soul! Better a thouſand times thou hadſt never been, than to have thus abuſed thy Being, in precipitating thy ſelf into ſo for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midable an Abyſs of woe. Wilt thou then, Oh my Soul, live the life of the Juſt by Faith, that thou maſt not always be dying this accurſed death of Hypocrites and Unbelievers; and be yet more grievouſly rack'd with diſmal expectations of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitely worſe to come? Shall inviſible and eternal things over-rule thee, as having a preſent ſenſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on or feeling of their reality? Canſt thou now and then take a turn in the ſuperiour World, as one come to <hi>Mount Sion, and unto the City of the Living God, the Heavenly Jeruſalem, and to an innu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merable company of Angels, to the General Aſſembly and Church of the firſt born, which are written in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, and to God the Judge of all, and to the Spirits of Juſt Men made perfect, and to Jeſus the Mediator of the New Covenant, and to the Blood of Sprinkling which ſpeaketh better things than that of Abel,</hi> Heb. 12.22, 23, 24? What report canſt thou give concerning
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:100687:26"/>the promiſed Land of Everlaſting Light, and Love and Life? Haſt thou ever been upon the Mount to take a proſpect of it? What remarkable thing therein has invited thy ſerious Meditations, to take a more ſtrict and narrow view, and make it thy perpetual repaſt and delight? Haſt thou walked through the breadth and the length thereof, in a diligent ſearch and ſurvey to behold the Beauty, the Sweetneſs, the Perfection, the Glory, of the Inhabitants; the Employments, the Fruits, the Enjoyments, the Entertainments, the Joys and Conſolations to be poſſeſt there, in an uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceivably rich degree of ſatisfactorineſs; where there's an everlaſting Spring, and an everlaſting Harveſt of unutterable Pleaſure and Contentation? Doſt thou even now enter upon thy lot and reſt there, <hi>Heb.</hi> 4.3. and live upon the riches of that Inheritance, making a ſpiritual livelyhood for thy ſelf out of the abundance and ſtore of Heaven? Where are thy Treaſures, thy Jewels and pleaſant things, thy moſt amiable and delectable Compani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons? <hi>Seeing him who is inviſible,</hi> Heb. 11.27. Canſt thou endure, and bear up under the Rage and Vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence of a turbulent ill-condition'd World; the Reproaches and Scorns of Men, the Fury of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils, the Pangs of Affliction; and in a calm of ſweet compoſure and reſt, anchor thy ſelf on the <hi>Rock of Ages,</hi> as thy beſt ſecurity and ſingular ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction. Really, Faith is all things, 'tis Wealth in Poverty, Health in Sickneſs, a good Report or Name under Defamations, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.2. Pleaſure in Pain, Reſt in Labour, Life in Death, a Heaven of Peace and Joy in a Hell of Miſery and Torment. If thou canſt not bleſs thy ſelf with the ſolace of a Friend on Earth, Faith will acquaint thee with, and endear thee to Multitudes in Heaven. Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:100687:27"/>thy Circumſtances be as deplorable as thy Redeemers, worſe than the Birds and Foxes; yet thy Faith has for thee <hi>a Houſe not made with Hands, Eternal.</hi> Is thy own Country or City too hot for thee? this Grace finds for thee <hi>a better Country, a City that hath Foundations, whoſe Builder and Maker is God,</hi> Heb. 11.16. <hi>By it commit the keeping of thy Soul in well doing to thy Faithful Creator. Eſpouſe the ever bleſſed Jeſus, embrace the Precepts, kiſs the Promiſes,</hi> Heb. 11.13. and then all's thine own, from the clod under thy Feet, to the height and crown of Heavenly Glory. For Faith to be a <hi>Menaicant</hi> is impoſſible. It has all and abounds, and is full, if it be a full unfeigned Faith. A Believer is never in want if he want not Faith, the due degree and meaſure of Faith. And the meaſure effectual and acceptable is not high; 'tis the Truth rather than Strength. A Grain will remove Mountains, <hi>Mat.</hi> 17.20. Make Trees to grow in the midſt of the Sea, <hi>Luke</hi> 17.6. Divide the Waters, and convert Seas and Rivers into dry Land, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.20. and make even a <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi>'s Hell-hot Furnace of Fire ſo forget its Property, as not to be able to ſinge a hair, <hi>Dan.</hi> 3.27. compar'd with <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.33, 34. Every thing muſt be a Rebel againſt its own Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and bow to the Omnipotency of Faith; that is to the Almightineſs of that infinite Nature, which is engag'd to, and by Faith. Oh then my Soul, where is thy Faith? What is thy Faith?</p>

The rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of this change I cannot determine, 'tis ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factory that it was made by the inſpiration of the <hi>Holy Ghoſt,</hi> who beſt knew his own meaning. But
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:100687:29"/>ſhall I offer a Conjecture? The Appellative <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam</hi> points to the firſt Man, from whom the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomination is drawn. And before his fall, no doubt <hi>Adam</hi> was poſſeſt of a degree of Wiſdom, paramount to all his Poſterity, <hi>Solomon</hi> not excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted; and this Name was impos'd upon him, when he flouriſh'd in the glory of that excellent Spirit. I do not queſtion, but that even in his collapſed Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, a degree thereof was preſerv'd ſuperiour to all in his Succeſſors, unto whom 'tis derived very much rebated, partly though corruption, partly through feminine imbecility. For the difference of natural abilities in Man and Man, or Man and Woman ariſes not from the ſpiritual part; all Souls being equal in Nature, Faculties and Power. But the defect of Vital Flame, or Natural Heat and Spirits cauſing an indiſpoſition of Organs in their firſt For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, with a coolneſs and torpidneſs in the Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal Spirits, the Souls Vehicle and immediate In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument in its Operations <hi>ad extra;</hi> is the true O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rigin of all thoſe Imperfections viſible in the Intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lectuals, both of that cooler Sex, and the other; and all may be encreaſed by the Immorality and Intem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perance of Parents, or other accidental Cauſes, Diſeaſes, Paſſions, External Occurrents, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Now may not St. <hi>Paul</hi> in tranſlating <hi>[Adam the wiſe]</hi> allude or have ſome reſpect to the incomparable Wiſdom of that ſource of Humane Nature? How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever it was moſt accommodate to the tenour of his Diſcourſe there, and not aliene from the ſcope of Place here. For undoubtedly thoſe he calls Brutiſh and Fools, <hi>ver.</hi> 8. and Proud, <hi>ver.</hi> 2. had no hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble apprehenſions of their own Abilities; but did imagin that in their Oppreſſions they dealt wiſely, as the <hi>Aegyptians,</hi> Exod. 1.10. <hi>Atheiſts, Deiſts, Perſecutors,</hi> generally conceiting themſelves the
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:100687:29"/>wiſeſt of Men, and the profoundeſt of Politicians; but the reſt of the World only a knot of Addle Eggs. Yet the <hi>Holy Ghoſt,</hi> who beſt knows, and never can be out in his Judgment of Men, both here and other where, even in this Book, calls them by their proper Names as <hi>Pſal.</hi> 14. and 53. <hi>Folly, Atheiſm, Perſecution,</hi> are both in Scripture and Nature individual inſeparable Companions, and no marvel. For if a Man can be ſuch a Fool as to turn God out of the World, and Being, in his Thoughts; no wonder if he be ſuch a Barbari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an as to turn Men, who are moſt God-like, out of the World, with his Hands; and again if a Man can be ſo beſtially Savage, as to embrew his Hands in the Blood of Innocents, 'tis his Intereſt to be ſo fooliſh as to believe there is no Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence and God. I therefore again demand whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it be poſſible, for a Man, living under the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion of theſe moſt rational Notions of God, and the folly, brutiſhneſs, and madneſs of working Iniquity, to contradict all the Principles of Senſe, Reaſon and Religion, in ſo high a degree as to invoive himſelf in the ſame Condemnation? Could a Man ſenſible of Divine obſervance of, and ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>madverſion upon vain Thoughts, indulge ſuch in his own Mind? and if not vain, ſure much leſs vile and wicked. Will a Man confidently belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving and aſſerting the all-intelligent Nature of God, here repreſented under the Metaphor of <hi>Hearing,</hi> dare to permit his Tongue to take an unbecoming <hi>Parrheſy,</hi> or liberty of bolting out any thing? Shall that Mouth ſpit froth or filth in the Face of Heaven, which profeſſes that 'tis all Ear and Eye? <hi>Laſtly,</hi> How can he who is ſo thorowly perſwaded of God's inſpection, with an avenging Eye, as to account thoſe brutiſh and
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:100687:30"/>Fools that disbelieve it: Be ſo impudently daring and flagitious, as (like that Blaſphemous <hi>Dicer</hi> in <hi>Fincelius</hi>) with impious and accurſed Hands to throw his Dagger againſt Heaven, and ſtick it in the Heart of God? Oh Helliſhneſs! Oh Horror! I mean be wicked in his Works, which is <hi>Dei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cide,</hi> or <hi>God-killing.</hi> Indeed a Man, <hi>i. e.</hi> one en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowed with intelligent and reaſoning Powers, who can proportion his Senſations to the nature of things, much more a <hi>Chriſtian Man,</hi> that borrows his Light and Eyes too, in a more eſpecial manner from Heaven, muſt needs behold more uglyneſs and odiouſneſs in Sin, than any thing imaginable. For we do not take our meaſures of Privatives, from themſelves meerly, but that poſitive Being and Goodneſs to which they are oppoſed, and the excellency of the Subject wherein they are ſeated. Blindneſs therefore in <hi>Man,</hi> the moſt noble Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture endowed with Senſe, is a greater evil than in a Brute, eſpecially ſince Man is capable of uſing ſight to more worthy and eximious purpoſes. Sin is a privation of Holyneſs, which is the only mean to bring Man to the poſſeſſion of infinite Goodneſs. Heb. 12.14. <hi>Without Holineſs no Man ſhall ſee the Lord.</hi> Matth. 5.8. <hi>Bleſſed are the pure in Heart for they ſhall ſee God.</hi> So <hi>Iſa.</hi> 33.15, 17. Sin therefore is the greateſt Evil, becauſe it deprives mediately of the greateſt Good natural [or ſupernatural] <hi>God;</hi> and as it deprives immediately of the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt good <hi>Moral Holineſs.</hi> As 'tis contrary to the purity of the Creature it is but a finite evil; but infinite as contrary to the Purity of the <hi>Creator.</hi> As a violation of the Law and Principles of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and Reaſon in us; 'tis only of a limitted Malignity, but of a boundleſs and unlimited Peſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency, as a violation of the Law and Principles of
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:100687:30"/>Holineſs in God. 'Tis a tranſgreſſion of the Law of God, therefore a contempt and ſcorn put upon his infinite Authority, and Juſtice, and Holineſs, and Power, and Goodneſs, and Glory, and Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs. One would imagin it was but a light mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to eat the Fruit of a Tree in Paradiſe; but 'twas no light matter to do it againſt a great God, againſt the expreſs prohibition, and in a ſlighting neglect of, or vilifying diſregard or deſpite to the ſevere Sanctions of an infinitely Wiſe, Holy and Juſt <hi>Creator.</hi> Therefore Infinitennſs it ſelf being concerned in Sin renders it exceeding ſinful; whence nothing in it more afflicts a good Soul, than its contrariety and offenſiveneſs to that glorious Majeſty. And indeed Sin as Sin is againſt none but God. The Facts that are ſinful as being againſt God, may be hurtful or injurious as againſt Men; but the formal nature of Sin lies not in that, neither is the violation of Humane Laws, therefore a Sin, becauſe againſt the Sanctions of Man; but only becauſe and as far as Violations of the Law of God, immediately in the matter, or remotely in the Tranſgreſſion of the Fifth Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand requiring ſubjection to Authority. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſays <hi>David,</hi> Pſal. 51.4. <hi>Againſt thee, thee only have I ſinned.</hi> What? Becauſe being King he was by no Man Challengable, to none accountable for any wrong but God alone? Admit this true in <hi>Theſi,</hi> yet in <hi>Hypotheſi</hi> 'tis abſurd and ridiculous, as part of an Addreſs to God, and an exerciſe of Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance. If it be not underſtood comparatively, or with reſpect to the formality of Sin; ſpoken ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely, 'tis abſolutely falſe. In Sin there is a Fault and a Guilt, ſo in <hi>David</hi>'s Murther, and A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dultery. Conſider the former, taking away Life is ſometimes Juſtice: When is it a Fault? only
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:100687:31"/>when againſt Law. What Law? God's or Man's? Not as againſt Man's further than as firſt againſt God's. For Man's Law cannot make that Murther which is Juſtice by the Law of God; nor the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary. That is Man cannot reverſe what God hath eſtabliſhed. 'Tis therefore the Divine Law in Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture or Scripture, and that alone which determines concerning the Faultineſs or Faultleſſneſs of mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters Originally and Architectonically; Man's Law only Secondarily and Subordinately. The formal reaſon then of the faultineſs is the contrariety to the Law of God. And nothing is Sin, meerly in reſpect of the matter, but the Formality. So the taking away <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>riah</hi>'s Life, was not a fault merely as taking away Life; for had he been a Criminal that would have been Juſtice: But a Sin it was only under the notion, as 'twas taken away under ſuch Circumſtances, as the Law of God diſſallow'd. The matter of the Sin therefore was againſt <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ah,</hi> but the Form and Eſſence of the Sin did conſiſt in nothing but only in its being againſt God, <hi>a Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſion of the Law of God,</hi> 1 Joh. 3.4. So then, 'tis not the Offence againſt Man ſimply and abſtractly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered; but the Offence againſt God, that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly and formally conſtitutes Sin. Every wrong that is in Sin to our ſelves, to Men, to our fellow Creatures, that groan under their thraldom to our Luſts, and fare worſe for their ſake, ſhould affect us, but moſt of all the wrong we do to God, as being the greateſt injury againſt the greateſt Majeſty. For even upon Earth, Crimes advance in their heinouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, according to the degree and dignity of Perſons. To call a mean Man <hi>Knave</hi> is a light matter, ſcarce actionable; to call a Nobleman, <hi>Scandalum Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natum,</hi> deeply finable; to call the King ſo, <hi>Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,</hi> puniſhable with Death. Oh then, what is
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:100687:31"/>Blaſphemy or any Sin againſt the <hi>King of Kings,</hi> the infinitely glorious <hi>King of Heaven and Earth.</hi> Common ſenſe will aſſure us, that the more miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief and hurt a Sin does, or may do, the greater it is, and merits greater Puniſhments. Now the more publick and uſeful any Perſons are, ſo much the more miſchievous are any actings againſt them; becauſe Government is eſſential to the good of the whole Community, and therefore thoſe who make attempts againſt Men in Publick Place and Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, ſtrike at and attempt the deſtruction of all ſubject to their Juriſdiction. To kill a Judge up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Bench is High Treaſon, both as a vertual acting againſt the King, and alſo as a murthering the Juſtice of the Nation, a violence againſt the Right, and Property, and Life of all, that are or may be in a capacity to receive Juſtice from him. So to kill the King is vertually a killing the whole Kingdom, with its Honour, Authority, Juſtice, Right, Property, Government, all that the King is entruſted with, the Privileges, Laws, Liberties, and Immunities of all Men. Sin there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore is an Evil tranſcendently great, above all Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion, above all Imagination, as a horrid miſchievous attempt againſt the Life, the All of God himſelf.</p>

Yea any the leaſt Sin is no leſs. One would think that a partly enforced tranſgreſſing a Law of God, in mere indifferent matter, when done with a good intention, for a good end, were the leaſt of all Sins.

Now Rebellion is Treaſon, to our power deſtroying the Soveraignty of God, therefore his Being and Life. But an attempt

               <p>But alas, this is only an Evil to thy ſelf, a poor mean chip of Being. Hell is but a ſenſible Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and Paraphraſe upon, indeed but an Epitome and Breviate of thoſe Evils which Sin attempts to inflict upon the Deity it ſelf; which being impaſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, as a Rock of Marble and Adamant, reverbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates and reflects back upon the Head of the Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, thoſe Arrows of Vengeance which were di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected againſt it. Were God capable of ſuffering, ſince he is infinitely ſenſible, Sin would torture him more than all the puniſhments of Hell can poſſibly do the Devils and Damned there. And the Son of God, for the ſame reaſon, and becauſe he ſuffered in ſuch a meaſure, as to give ſatisfaction, which all the Eternal Cruciations of the Damned can never do; did actually feel more evil in Sin, though he never committed any, than there can be
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:100687:34"/>evil in the everlaſting Woes of Hell. And 'tis but juſt retaliation, to make the Violaters of that Law of Grace, eſtabliſhed by this Son of God, for the recovery of loſt Man, and his deliverance from the Wrath to come, even all unbelieving finally Impenitents, to feel ſomething of the evil of that wherein he felt much more, and from which they will not be ſaved by him. Oh then my Soul, awake thy ſenſe, and ſuffer with him in this Life, under ſome paining doleful Reflections upon the evil and ſinfulneſs of thy Sin, as an offence and wrong to him. Oh be in bitterneſs for it, for him, as one is in bitterneſs and mourns for his Firſt-born. Let nothing more afflict and vex thee, than the diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſingneſs of thy Sin to God, the deſpite in it to the ſupreme Majeſty of Heaven. Bleed over thoſe Wounds thy Sin has given the Lord of Life and Glory; be every day ſick of that which made him die; aggravate it to the height in thy Meditati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; and look to Heaven with the moſt ardent and paſſionate deſires, that God would every day impreſs ſomething more of his own Image upon thee, that thou mayſt hate Sin with the hatred of God himſelf.</p>

Neither is it uſual for any Sinner, with ſeriouſneſs to look up to God, till he be firſt knock'd down by the dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful menaces of the Law. Attrition is generally an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tecedent to Contrition, though often the motions to Contrition be firſt preſented. God himſelf humbles us ere he will exalt us. When the gentle attractives of Grace cannot draw us, the Terrors of his Wrath muſt drive us home to our Father's Houſe. When God prevails not by the Cords of a Man the Bands of Love, to win us into an ingenu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous acknowledgement of him; he will further try to vanquiſh our ſtubbornneſs, by the direful Scorpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of his Indignation. And 'twas not incongruous for the Pſalmiſt to expreſs a Love to the Perſons even of wicked Perſecutors, in the ſame Methods that were made uſe of by his Maker. <hi>Laſtly,</hi> His conſcience of Duty to his Superiours, is plain from <hi>ver.</hi> 21, 22. compared. For though in <hi>ver.</hi> 21. he ſpeaks indefinitely, and in general of condemning the <hi>Righteous and Innocent Blood;</hi> yet the next <hi>ver.</hi> is determinate, and particular, plainly demonſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting,
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:100687:35"/>that the <hi>Righteous</hi> and <hi>Innocent</hi> he ſpoke of were no other than himſelf, or that at leaſt he was one of them. <hi>They condemn the Righteous and Innocent Blood; but the Lord is my defence.</hi> Imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent, if it were not, <hi>They condemn my Righteous Soul, my Innocent Blood.</hi> And of <hi>David</hi> this was undoubtedly true as he elſewhere witneſſes, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 59.3, 4. <hi>The Mighty are gathered againſt me, not for my Tranſgreſſion, nor for my Sin, O LORD. They run and prepare themſelves without my Fault.</hi> There they were gathered together, here they <hi>gather themſelves together;</hi> but 'twas againſt one whoſe Conſcience did not challenge him for any Crime that could merit this at their Hands. He could appeal to the Lord, to be a Witneſs of his <hi>Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs</hi> and <hi>Innocency</hi> as to them, who as to him were not Righteous and Innocent, but framed miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief againſt him by a Law. But I cannot imagine, that in a ſolemn Addreſs to God, this Holy Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon would profeſs to be ſo juſt and harmleſs, if it were only ſo in outward ſemblance and act. Could he diſſemble ſo groſsly (that is act the part of a Knave to God and Man) as to pretend theſe, and yet permit his Mind and Heart inwardly to boyl over in Gall and Bitterneſs, ready upon all occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to break out into Injury and Violence? Did he not know that the inward Luſt is as really a violati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Innocence, as the outward Act? And durſt he tell the Searcher of Hearts, that he was Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent, when his Heart was Guilty? Well that which was juſt and right he practiſed, and his Tongue and Soul did not move in a contradiction to his Hands. No hurt he did, offer'd no wrong, either in Thought, Word or Deed. He was active for their good in Righteouſneſs; but not at all to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compence them Evil for Evil in Rancour and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge.
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:100687:36"/>Had he taken a contrary Courſe? Had he been any other than paſſive under their active Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice, it might have been a juſt impeach to both his Righteouſneſs and Innocency. Does he right that with-holds from Man his due? Does he no harm that acts to the prejudice and hurt of another? Let it then be granted, that his activity in an oppoſite way would have rendred him Guilty.</p>
               <p>Particularly, 'twas a Throne of Iniquity that did perſecute him, for no Crime of his own: Yet you ſee he does not in the leaſt attempt or deſign to avenge himſelf with his own Hand, or ſtretch it out againſt the Lord's Anointed, as he ſpeaks 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 26.9, 11. He peremptorily determines, that it could not be done without Guilt. Thus here he appropriates Revenge ſolely to God, as his Royalty and Prerogative, <hi>ver.</hi> 1. it belongs to thee; and what then has any other to do with it? This is a plain renunciation of all right to it him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf: The Repetition cannot but have a ſingular Emphaſis. Twice, <hi>O Lord God of Revenges,</hi> or <hi>to whom Vengeance belongs.</hi> Sure the Holy Penman would not have born up himſelf in Conſcience of Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence, with reſpect either to God or Man, had he harboured any deſigns to uſurp the proper Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of the <hi>God of Revenges,</hi> in ſeeking by Vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence to right himſelf, againſt that Throne of Ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity, which even by a Law endeavoured to do him manifeſt wrong. So Sacred is the Majeſty of a Prince, that a good Conſcience cannot be main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd in affronting it, though it act Unrighteouſly, much leſs when it acts righteouſly under an abſolute and unlimited Monarchy. There's no relief on Earth againſt a Throne, though of Iniquity. From its unjuſt Judgment we have with the Pſalmiſt liberty of Appeal to Heaven; but to attempt otherways,

               <p>Since then the Command to obey is indubitable, what muſt I do when the matter commanded is not indubitably Lawful or Unlawful?

Suppoſe I have weighty reaſons to induce me to believe the unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs, and but common to eſtabliſh the lawful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; only they are enforc'd with the weight of Authority; I am not ſatisfy'd beyond all ſcruple, that I ſhall not ſin againſt God in obeying Man; yet the Arguments from God's Law in Scripture, Nature, and the Reaſon of the thing would bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lance my Judgment, did not that inartificial Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment interpoſe, the Judgment of many Learned and
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:100687:39"/>Reverend Men, the Judgment of the Publick Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience as of late it loves to be call'd. How ſhall I ſteer in this Caſe?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> 1. The higheſt deference is to be made to <hi>the Publick Judgment of Authority, and the Private Judgment of the Learned;</hi> and I am obliged to ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect my own Judgment, and Reaſon, when it runs counter to theirs; and proceed with the greateſt Caution and Impartiality, in forming my Senti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and Arguments, and beware of Pride and Obſtinacy; give a full teſtimony of my Humility and willingneſs to be informed, and uſe all poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble means for that purpoſe.</p>
               <p n="2">2. 'Tis a very unſafe reſolution of this Caſe, which I find in the Reverend and Judicious Dr. <hi>Saunderſon, Better obey doubtingly, than diſobey doub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tingly;</hi> as allowing a leſs Sin to avoid a greater. For the Apoſtle, <hi>Rom.</hi> 14. <hi>ult.</hi> determines, that to act doubtingly is a Sin, immediately againſt Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, mediately againſt God. For ſince Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience ſuſpects the Act to be a Sin againſt God, yet admits it againſt its own ſenſe, 'tis all one to it as if it were really a Sin againſt God, though perhaps it be not. The Act is againſt the ſuppoſed Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of God, which at preſent the Conſcience takes to be real, therefore this diſtemper of Conſcience is as real Rebellion againſt God, as if it acted againſt the cleareſt Light imaginable. For apparent and real to Conſcience are all one, though not in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves.</p>
               <p>The Law of God in General, makes Sin and Duty, but not immediately to me in particular, whilſt I am inculpably ignorant of it: Promulga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion being eſſential to the obligatorineſs of a Law. Except it be ſo publiſh'd that none without their fault can be ignorant of it, they are without fault
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:100687:40"/>in the violation of it. The next and immediate ground of the binding of a Law, is the apprehenſion and conviction of Conſcience, that it is impoſed by juſt Authority, with an intention to bind as a Law; or that it is a Law obligatory in its own Nature. Not that Laws ſtand or fall by the Judgment of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, as if Conſcience's judging them to be or not be Laws, gave or depriv'd them of their Obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory Power; but that if there be ſufficient light to make it out to Conſcience (not wittingly and willingly prejudic'd and blinded) that this is, or is not, the will of the Lawgiver, ſupreme or ſubor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinate; accordingly it is, or is not, obliged to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive and own this as Law. For if it be clear to any rational conſideration what the Legiſlators Mind is, with his intention to bind to obſervance; this is a ſufficient Promulgation, and doth imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately found the Obligatorineſs to us. In ſhort an unknowable Law binds none; becauſe not to be, and not to be known or knowable, is to us all one. But as ſoon as known, the Law binds the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er. For as Dr. <hi>Saunderſon</hi> well determines, <hi>The pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Light in the Mind for the time being, is the next and immediate Rule of Conſcience; though not the ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme and adequate. And if this Light be derived from, and conformable to its prime and higheſt Rule, the Will of God revealed in Nature or Scripture,</hi> in acting ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to it, 'tis a good and right Conſcience; but bad when acting againſt its Light and Senti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, though they be erroneous, <hi>i. e.</hi> contrary to the revealed mind of God. For an erring Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience hampers and entangles a Man, though it really oblige not; becauſe the Man judges that really to be the Mind of God, which is indeed an Error, though to him unknown ſo to be. Finally acting againſt an erring Conſcience is formally evil,
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:100687:40"/>thongh materially good. Acting according to an erroneous Conſcience, is formally good, but mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rially evil. Acting againſt a well informed Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence both materially and formally evil. Therefore that a Man may act without preſent and future re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buke of Conſcience, both his Light and his Act muſt be according to Rule. For then only 'tis both materially and formally Good, and except it be both, 'tis not acceptable to God; except it be both, the Man is not (though he may fanſie him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to be) really Innocent.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Where therefore both to obey and diſobey is queſtionable, a Man muſt not ſin againſt his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, doubting about the matter commanded, to avoid ſining againſt his Conſcience, doubting a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the Authority commanding. For both are carefully to be eſchewed; but,
<list>
                     <item>1. If the Command require not preſent obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance, but permit a ſuſpence for a ſeaſon, a Man muſt diligently uſe all means, with all ſpeed and readineſs of Mind, to get his doubts one way or other reſolved, out of the revealed Will of God, which is the Rule of Conſcience. For that which ties Conſcience muſt looſe it, or 'tis faſt for ever. As it has a Rule to bind, ſo it muſt have a Rule to unbind it. Pretended Conſcience without Rule is but Conceit: Conſcience againſt Rule, Corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</item>
                     <item>2. If no time be allow'd for ſuſpence, or if in the uſe of the utmoſt means no Reſolution can be obtain'd; a Man muſt quietly and patiently ſubmit to the Penalty. To ſuffer though for an erring Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience is no ſin, if the beſt have been done to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect it aright; but 'tis always a ſin to act againſt Conſcience, whether reſolv'd or doubting, as an evident and impudent affronting the real or ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:100687:41"/>Authority of God, owned by Conſcience. If then the Authorities and Powers ſet over thee be good, and command Lawful things, thou muſt be ſubject in Active Obedience; elſe thou ſinneſt both againſt God and the King, and thy Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence too, if it know them to be ſuch. If the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme Magiſtrates be Erroneous, Heretical, Wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, Tyrannical, thou muſt be ſtill ſubject, in Active Obedience to their Lawful Commands, in Paſſive to their Unlawful. To a Tyrant with Title, both in Body and Mind. To a Tyrant without Title, in Body. For thy Mind and Heart muſt follow the Title and Right though thy outward Man be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlaved to the Uſurpation. Subjection then is abſolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly indiſpenſible to all Powers whatſoever. Even as 'tis in the caſe of Parents and Children, Maſters and Servants; which therefore are together with Prince and People, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> comprehended under one general Name in the <hi>Fifth Command,</hi> and the Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of the Inferiours under the common notion of <hi>Honour.</hi> That we may rationally carry the particular Inſtances of that Honour from any one ſort to all the reſt reſpectively, <hi>mutatis mutandis.</hi> And poſſibly this may be one reaſon of St. <hi>Peter</hi>'s ſubjoyning the Duties of Servants immediately after thoſe of Subjects, 1 <hi>Epiſt.</hi> 2.13.

From Servants, parity, nay ſuperiority of Reaſon will carry the Rule to Subjects, in as much as the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit of the Publick is a more noble and neceſſary end, than that of a Private Family, and the neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect thereof more fatal and dangerous, iſſuing in Blood, Ruin and Confuſion.</p>
               <p>And now ſeeing Laws ſo ſtrict and ſevere are impoſed upon Inferiours by God, neceſſitating their obedience; a ſingular Prudence, Tenderneſs and Conſcience is required in Superiours as they reſpect their own Salvation, to ſee that they impoſe no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing by their Authority, that may intangle Men in Sin or Snares, as underſtanding that they are only Lords over their outward Man, not their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences, and that compulſion to Sin renders the Compeller a Principal, and therefore if he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form not lyable to a great ſhare of the <hi>Damnation.</hi> However the Subject Party may with a good Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience obey, (as in paying unreaſonable Taxes) where the Supreme does not maintain a good Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience in commanding, but grievouſly ſins both againſt Man and God.</p>
               <p>I have made a large Excurſion, (if that be not an impertinent Word, in ſo pertinent a caſe) 1. To obviate a Slander, as though we generally enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd odd and unſound Principles, contrary to the Duty of Subjects. 2. To direct the tendereſt part of Man, in the tendereſt point of general and preſent Concernment. 3. To correct the unſound
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:100687:42"/>and unſafe Principles of two Extremes, 1. Of ſome, who needleſsly to advance Authority, do too much debaſe Conſcience. 2. Of others who in an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grounded deference to Conſcience, too much de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preciate and depreſs Authority. I heartily ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe to the Doctrine of <hi>Rom.</hi> 13. in the full lati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of its ſence, and readily acknowledge, that <hi>Rom.</hi> 14. follows after it; but muſt not deny that the one as well as the other is part of Canonical Scripture, of the Chriſtian Law, of perpetual Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligation, nor affirm that one is inconſiſtent with, and abrogates the other.</p>
               <p>The chief Exerciſe of Conſcience towards Men is towards the chief of Men. God's Vicegerents on Earth may claim the firſt reſpect from his Vice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerent in our Souls; but muſt not engroſs all en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely. We in Conſcience are obliged to a further Duty to Inferiours and Equals, nay even Enemies; in all things to ſeek their good, that's <hi>Righteouſneſs,</hi> in nothing to do them hurt, that's <hi>Innocency:</hi> In every thing to pleaſe them for their good to Edifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, <hi>Rom.</hi> 15.1, 2, 3. that's <hi>Perfection.</hi> 'Tis true, I am a Devil, if I humour Men in their Luſts, indulge them in their Impieties and Senſualities: A Dog if I fawn upon and flatter them in their Extravagances, for my own ends.

I will keep my way, and follow my Light and my Rule; if any be diſpleaſed with it, let them bark on, and bite too, it hurts me not. I'll give away my Goods, and my Labours, and my Liberty, yea and even my Life, as far as I can, with a good Conſcience, to pleaſe, ſo as ſpiritually to profit;
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:100687:43"/>but give away my Light, my Rule, my Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, I will not, I dare not, I cannot. 'Tis a double ſcandal giv'n firſt to me, when Men would thus Biaſs me, to a blind Servitude, unto their Wills; another to them, when in a fond aſſentatiouſneſs, I become a Pander to their laſcivient Humours, and imperious Imaginations. My Soul is of a more noble Extraction and Temper, than to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſe it ſelf, to the turn-skin trade of a <hi>Paraſite,</hi> like a Serpent, with the ſame Tongue to lick and kill, or Great <hi>Alexander</hi>'s Miſs, who was fed with no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but Poyſons that her kiſſes might be delete<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious and Murder him. No lighter would my Crime be ſhould I violate my Conſcience, in being a pleaſer of Man rather than God.</p>
               <p>Neither therefore in this nor any other way will I ſcandalize my Brother knowingly, nor muſt he exerciſe that Tyranny over my Conſcience, as to give other Law to it, beſides what God hath pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed in Nature or Scripture. My Practice ſhall be at his Devotion, as far as it doth not intrench upon my duly regulated Judgment, and wary will I be, that no unweighed Sentiments arreſt my Mind, and miſguide my Conſcience. I'll have an Eye, and an Ear, and a Heart open to receive all Truth freely, without Prejudice or Partiality, and this from any hands whatever, examining and proving all things, as fully as the infirmity of my intellect will permit. But a ſlavery to the Opinions of Men againſt the balance of mine own clear and diſtinct Reaſonings I abhor.</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. I will not do any thing which is every way indifferent, if it be likely in it ſelf, or be found by experience of a tempting Nature and Tenden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, If any Man, either through the quality of my Act, or the power of my Example, in matters of
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:100687:43"/>that nature, be drawn into Sin; or if it be very pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable that he will, upon ſuch inducements, either tranſgreſs the Law of God, or imitate me with a doubting Conſcience; here will I freely forbear the uſe of my Liberty, to prevent his Sin, that I may not make it my own by Participation; but then I muſt not omit any known Duty, nor com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit any known Sin my ſelf, though poſſibly it might prevent his Sin. For I muſt not venture my own Soul by diſhonouring God, to preſerve ano. <hi>Do Evil, that Good may come,</hi> Rom. 3.8.</item>
                  <item>2. But if in indifferent things, my Liberty be determined, as by the command of a Lawful Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periour, I am in a greater ſtrait. For not to obey the Magiſtrate in Lawful things is a Sin; and by my Practice to induce my weak Brother to Sin, in imitating me, is alſo a Sin; What Rule has my Conſcience in this Perplexity? It muſt be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered,</item>
               </list>
               <p n="1">1. That my weak Brother's forbearance to obey, in a lawful thing is a Sin againſt God, though not his Conſcience; and therefore my forbearance will edifie him in Sin againſt the Law of God, that commands Obedience, although it prevent the Sin againſt his Conſcience; and the error of this can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not null the Sin againſt that. So that forbear or not forbear I ſcandalize him, in the one really, in the other putatively; when he acts againſt his Conſcience he thinks he ſins againſt God in the matter done, but does not; in diſobeying Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity he ſins againſt God, yet thinks it not. In this he ſins immediately againſt God, becauſe he diſobeys God's civil Vicegerent in Publick, in the other he ſins mediately againſt God, becauſe he diſobeys his Spiritual Vicegerent in Private. Now
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:100687:44"/>I conceive that my way here is to do my Duty in obeying the Magiſtrate, wherein I ſin not, whereas I doubly ſin if I do not. 1. Againſt the Law of Subjection and Obedience, ingaging me to the Magiſtrate. 2. The Law of Charity that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires me not to ſcandalize my Brother. If to gratifie his ſcrupuloſity I forbear, I do certainly know that he ſins in diſobeying. But 'tis only an accidental ſcandal may or may not happen, that he ſhould be emboldned by my Example, to act againſt his Conſcience.</p>
               <p>To throw this off the Stage, enter Chriſtian Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty; which to reſtrain is Sin, though by a Perſon in Authority, having Laws under him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> True, but then be ſure that it be indeed Chriſtian Liberty, leaſt aſſerting it forfeit and loſe your civil and corporal Liberty. Now becauſe a right underſtanding and uſe of Chriſtian Liberty hath a ſpecial influence into Comfort and Peace of Conſcience. Let's a little conſider it.</p>
               <p>Let it be heedfully obſerved, that true Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Liberty doth not conſiſt meerly in the indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent uſe or omiſſion of things not commanded nor forbidden, but in the <hi>releaſe of Conſcience from an obligation to do or omit ſome things, under pain of Damnation.</hi> Thus are we ſet at Liberty from the rigour of the Law or Covenant of Works, which required perfect, perſonal and perpetual Obedience, upon peril of Death. The Covenant of Grace doth not diſoblige from ſuch obedience, but from the peril of Death, though we come ſhort, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided we act ſincerely. This is the main of our Chriſtian Liberty. <hi>Not a freedom to do or not do, but a freedom from Penalty, upon an eaſter Condition.</hi> And this is all our Hope, Comfort, and Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <pb n="65" facs="tcp:100687:44"/>
               <p> Under the Jewiſh Law were included many <hi>Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonials,</hi> things in their own nature neither Good nor Evil; yet that Law made the omiſſion of them Sin, expoſing to Damnation. Chriſt by his Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel hath ſet us at Liberty. How? What, to do or omit them at Pleaſure? No ſuch matters. For then 'twere lawful to Sacrifice, to keep the Paſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, to Circumciſe, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> as well as forbear. No, the Liberty granted us muſt be doubly diſtinguiſh'd.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Into <hi>Natural</hi> and <hi>Adventitious.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Indifferency of the uſe or omiſſion of Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful things, is a part of Natural not Adventitious Liberty, which underſtand thus.</p>
               <p>Some things which were in their own Nature lawful to be uſed, or not uſed, God determined on one ſide, by poſitive Law, under the <hi>Moſaical Diſpenſation:</hi> But over and above there were things made the matter of poſitive Laws, which would never have entred into the Imaginations of Men, had not the firſt notices thereof come from God. Who could ever have thought of ſuch a thing as Circumciſion, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> had not the firſt In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction thereof proceeded from Heaven. Our Natural Liberty did conſiſt in a freedom from that, and like Yoaks. But not in an indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rency to uſe or not uſe them. So then, by the Law of our Native Liberty, we may uſe or not uſe ſome things without Sin; there's an indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rency on both ſides; as to take up a Straw or let it alone, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Yet alſo the indifferency does na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally lie only on one ſide, in other things as to continue the Body in its Natural State, without Circumciſion. But God for wiſe and holy pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes having abridged the <hi>Jews</hi> of this Natural Liberty for a ſeaſon; when the reaſon of thoſe Laws ceaſed, was pleas'd to aboliſh them, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:100687:45"/>by we became reinſtated in our natural Right and Freedom, which otherwiſe thoſe Laws, when de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vulged to us, would have taken from us. Now the reaſon of impoſing thoſe Laws was to ſuccour the infirmity of the <hi>Jews</hi> in two things.</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. In <hi>Faith,</hi> of which nature are all the things impos'd which have a Typical ſignificancy, as <hi>Sacrifices, &amp;c.</hi>
                  </item>
                  <item>2. In <hi>Manners,</hi> of which ſort are all that have a moral ſignificancy, as <hi>Meats, Waſhings,</hi> &amp;c.</item>
               </list>
               <p>But now <hi>Jeſus</hi> the ſubſtance of thoſe Typical Shadows, being come in the Fleſh, the Laws con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning them were <hi>ipſo facto</hi> vacated; and by the more plentiful effuſion of his Spirit of Truth and Grace, thorowly furniſhing Men for exact Moral Goodneſs, he took away the neceſſity both of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membring us thereof, and eeking it out by <hi>Waſhings, Circumciſion,</hi> &amp;c. The Scriptures of the Old and New Teſtament as a compleat Law from the Spirit of Truth, doing the one more ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently than a few dumb ſigns; and the New Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture communicated by the Spirit of Grace, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with Chriſt's Merit all-ſufficiently doing the other. This is the Liberty I call</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Adventitious,</hi> not that 'tis new but newly gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven; not that we never had it, but had it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtor'd, after an interruption. During the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraint 'twas ſin to uſe it. To Chriſt we owe, that now we may again uſe it without ſin, as at firſt before God abridged it; and this is that we call <hi>Chriſtian Liberty</hi> in things indifferent as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiſtinct to <hi>Natural.</hi> For Chriſt as Redeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er did not parchaſe our Natural Liberty, but gave it as Creator: 'Tis only the Adventitious that we enjoy, by vertue of his Merit; 'tis only this
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:100687:45"/>that we are entruſted with the Preſervation and Vindication of, by the New Teſtament.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Liberty is either <hi>Poſitive</hi> or <hi>Negative.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The former conſiſts in an indifferency to act this, or that, or the other way at pleaſure. The latter in being loos'd from the obligation to act. That which <hi>Chriſt</hi> the <hi>Redeemer</hi> beſtows, is chiefly of this latter ſort. We are diſobliged, looſed from the Ceremonial Bands wherewith the <hi>Jews</hi> were tyed, ſo as we need not to act as they, under that <hi>Oeconomy.</hi> 'Tis no ſin to us to omit; incurrs no Penalty. And this freedom from the guilt and puniſhment due for Omiſſion, is indeed a privilege, which conſtitutes the very eſſence of the Covenant of Grace, in one part of it. The tenor thereof in its Negative part being this, viz. <hi>Thy Imperfections, Failures, Omiſſions, ſhall not be imputed as Sins effecting thy Damnation.</hi> This for want of a better Word I call <hi>Negative Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.</hi> Although thou do not Circumciſe, do not Sacrifice, do not Eat a Paſchal Lamb, do not Waſh, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> thou doſt not ſin, thou ſhalt not be cut off from thy People, from my Heaven. This and none other in theſe indifferent Matters is Chriſtian Liberty, the Purchaſe and Gift of Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt our Lord.</p>
               <p>So that except Magiſtrates do again introduce the Ceremonial Law in whole or part, they do not at all touch upon Chriſtian Liberty, but Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural only, which they are allow'd to reſtrain in ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil things, upon juſt occaſions, as is evident from not only Scripture and Reaſon, but the practice of all Nations, and Ages, and Families, For would it not be ſweet to hear a Child or Servant reply to their Superiours, commanding them to light a Candle, <hi>&amp;c. 'Tis not lawful for you to reſtrain
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:100687:46"/>my Liberty. Had you not commanded I might have obey'd, but your impoſing has made it unlawfal.</hi> Oh dainty, delicate Reaſoning! Yet ſuch as ſome fob off their Conſciences withal. 'Tis the ſame thing, when they command in the Circumſtantials of Divine Worſhip, <hi>&amp;c. I charge you to be preſent at Eight of the Clock, Morning and Evening, to joyn in Family Prayer,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>No, had you not impos'd a time 'twould have been lawful, now 'tis not.</hi> Away with this Foolery.</p>
               <p>In Civils then, and Circumſtantials of Spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als the Magiſtrate hath a Power, not meerly di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rective but legiſlative, to whoſe Laws all are ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged to be ſubject in Conſcience of the Divine Law, the Fifth Command.</p>
               <p>Now ſuppoſe the Magiſtrate by a ſettled Law have enjoyned ſome things, in their own nature indifferent, which, 1. Induce ſome to act againſt their doubting Conſciences, for fear of Penalty; whereas. 2. Others are well ſatisfied in the lawful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of their Obedience, and accordingly do actually obey; but ſome may be induc'd by their example to obey with a heſitant Conſcience. What is ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſable?</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. Though the greateſt tenderneſs ought to be exerciſed towards Mens Conſciences, and ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular Prudence be requiſite in Governors to direct them in the choice of Laws, that they may ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain with the greateſt inoffenſiveneſs; yet will not Mens being ſcandaliz'd be a ſufficient evidence of the ſinfulneſs of a Law, or ground to reverſe it, unleſs the ſcandal be very general, among the beſt, and wiſeſt, or ſomething in the matter or ſanction of the Law be at leaſt a moral cauſe thereof. For what can ſo politickly or wiſely be devis'd which Men of ſoft Heads, and hot Hearts,
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:100687:46"/>may not make occaſion of Sin; that there would never be an end of making and repealing Laws, if Men can but pretend ſcandal, and who beſide God knows what is pretence meerly, what not?</item>
                  <item>2. If fear of the Penalty occaſion the Scandal, from a Law about Indifferents; thoſe are not faultleſs who have not proportion'd the Penalty to the Crime, an indifferent tolerable pain to an indifferent fault.</item>
                  <item>3. Yet to be ſcandaliz'd or act againſt my Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, for fear of ſuffering, is a Sin, the cauſe or inducement whereof will not excuſe though it may extenuate it. Will it avail a Man to ſay; <hi>I violated my Conſcience through Fear,</hi> any more than <hi>I vitiated my Neighbours Wife through Luſt;</hi> when the Fear and Luſt themſelves are Sins as well as thoſe they introduce. Therefore the Rule is, <hi>Suffer rather than Sin.</hi>
                  </item>
                  <item>4. Either 'tis evident <hi>de facto,</hi> that ſome are ſcandaliz'd through a Law, or Example, or 'tis morally certain 'twill follow; or probable; or only poſſible. This laſt and probability, except the preſumption be ſtrong, are not to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garded.</item>

               <list>
                  <item>1. If the Law cannot be revers'd without pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice to publick order, nor a diſpenſation ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd, Men muſt not defame Laws, but ſubmit. For the Law does not neceſſitate Sin, there's an out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate by ſuffering. Yet if the Law be needleſs; 'tis the firſt duty in the uſe of lawful means, to endeavour its Abrogation, or get a Diſpenſation, which if not feiſible, I ſay with <hi>Calvin,</hi>

               </list>
               <p>For although my Charity may induce me for a ſeaſon to be willing to ſuffer for his ſake, yet my Conſcience will not permit me to do it always.
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:100687:47"/>Not that I pretend Conſcience to prevent ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; but becauſe active Obedience, where I can is the primary intention of God in the Law that ſubjects me to the Magiſtrate, and therefore the firſt and main office of Conſcience. Paſſive Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience is not the intention of the Law giver at all, in the Law as a Law, as being not enjoyn'd there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in; 'tis only the enforcement of it, as a remedy againſt its violation; the hedge about it. 'Twill be no plea before God, to juſtifie my breach of his Laws, that I was willing to be damn'd; but an aggravation of my ſin, that I choſe ſo great an Evil as the Puniſhment, rather than ſubmiſſion to ſo great a Good as the Duty. I am bound to ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend my Obedience, if I can, to prevent my Brothers Sin; but not ſinally to deny my Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence and therein ſin my ſelf; to prevent his ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering, that is, damn my Soul, to ſave his Skin.</p>
               <p>Wilt thou then, O my Soul, herein follow Chriſt, and perfectly ſubjugate thy ſelf to that noble Law of <hi>

Whatever thou wouldſt have others to do to thee, do thou to them; what thou wouldſt not have them to do to thee, do not to them. Make their caſe thine, and act toward them as thy ſelf.

               <p>But 'tis not enough, O my Soul, to partake of a Moral, thou muſt aſpire after a <hi>Divine Nature, as well as eſcape, or fly from the Corruption in the World in Luſt, or Concupiſcence,</hi> 2 Pet 2.4. <hi>To love thy ſelf into Sobriety or Prudent ſelf Government, to cloath thy ſelf with a Robe of Righteouſneſs and Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy in thy dealings with Men,</hi> is not enough, is not the full and adequate Doctrine and Duty taught by the <hi>Grace of God which brings Salvation,</hi> Titus 2.11.

For what Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience in dealing well with Men, and ill with God? that is with the Subjects fairly, and not with the Soveraign? What Conſcience in break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the firſt Article betwixt God and Man, which is to give him the ſole command in his Houſe, thy Heart that living Temple, which is the ſum of the Firſt Commandment? What Conſcience to dwell in his Houſe and pay him no Rent? No external Acknowledgment and Worſhip, in Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick, in thy Family, in thy Cloſet? the ſum of

What Conſcience in ſtealing time from God's reſerved part, when he allows thee ſo much beſide? the Fourth Command violated. Be never ſo ſober, juſt, free, kind to Man-ward, if thou reſpect not God, O my Soul, thou haſt no Conſcience. For where there's no <hi>Godlineſs,</hi> there can be no <hi>Conſcience.</hi> Oh, make it thy firſt and main bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs to approve thy ſelf to God.

               <p n="5">5. THis Holy Man was of a Publick Spirit, li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving under a Catholick ſence of, and care for the common concerns of the Church of God. Lamenting its Miſeries, <hi>ver.</hi> 5, 6. longing and praying for its redemption from them by the
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:100687:49"/>Power and Juſtice of God, <hi>ver.</hi> 1, 2, 3, 4, 20. and encouraging his own and its hopes thereof, by a ſerious reflection upon the Divine Attributes, <hi>ver.</hi> 1, 2, 8, 9, 10, 11. Providences, <hi>ver.</hi> 12, 13. and his own particular experience, <hi>ver.</hi> 17, 18, 19, 21. withal by a Prophetick Spirit foretelling it, <hi>ver.</hi> 14, 15, 23. all which are plain in the Pſalm, and plain demonſtrations of a Heart en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larged in its deſires, and endeavours for Publick Good. A good Soul is not well at eaſe when the Servants of God are ill at eaſe. The Sufferings of the Church are made its own by a ſympathi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing Spirit, which is afflicted in all its Afflictions, and cannot enjoy Proſperity, or it ſelf in Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentation, when God's Children are groaning un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Croſs: Mourns with Mourning, Rejoyces with rejoycing <hi>Sion,</hi> and uſes its intereſt in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, to work upon the Bowels of the ever-bleſſed Son of God, that he may demonſtrate his tender Commiſerations toward his own Members in Miſery, by turning the courſe of his Providence. And that this is a proper method to Comfort we ſee, <hi>Iſai.</hi> 66.10, 11. <hi>Rejoyce ye with Jeruſalem, and be glad with her, all ye that love her, rejoyee for joy with her, all ye that mourn for her; that ye may ſuck and be ſatisfied, with the Breaſts of her Conſolations, that ye may milk out and be delighted with the abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of her Glory.</hi> God had a People, a Heritage, which though <hi>Afflicted and broken in pieces</hi> here, <hi>ver.</hi> 5. yet he would not caſt off nor forſake, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in reſpect of <hi>Affection</hi> or <hi>Communion, ver.</hi> 14. So neither muſt we. For 'tis by Vertue of our Union and Communion with that Body, and its Head, that all thoſe comfortable Spirits and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluences are derived to us, which refreſh and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vive us. I confeſs 'tis through our internal and
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:100687:49"/>ſpiritual Confederation and Fellowſhip; but he that values and receives benefit by this, cannot deſpiſe and vilifie the External. Hence our Pſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſt here, as a Member vitally joined to the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, and partaking of a common Senſe, does not only comfort himſelf and it, with the conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the inviolableneſs of that Union and Communion which was of a ſpiritual Nature, <hi>ver.</hi> 14. nor only reflects upon thoſe external Liga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and Bonds which ty'd together ſo numerous a People, into one ſingle <hi>Heritage</hi> or <hi>Church;</hi> but alſo was grievouſly afflicted for thoſe external breakings in pieces, rents and diſunion of parts, though involuntary, which were the fruit of the outward Violence and Rage of Perſecutors. So ſhould we. But then, Oh what Affliction would have rent his tender Heart, in the view of thoſe voluntary tearing in pieces the Seamleſs Coat of Chriſt, the Diviſions and Breaches we make a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt our ſelves. Thoſe Fractions were only ſome kind of diſſolution of their Civil, Political Union, ours of the Eccleſiaſtical; and Wounds are moſt dangerous in the moſt noble Parts. State Factions are not more to be dreaded, than thoſe of the Church, becauſe theſe have more immediate reſpect to the Soul and God.</p>
               <p>Lamentable are the Miſeries of a Civil War, where Thouſands Born, Bred up, Nouriſhed by one common Mother, Brethren by Stock, Blood, Condition, Cohabitation, Memberſhip of the ſame Body Politick, perhaps of one Name, and Kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred, and Family, of the ſame Body Myſtical, the Church; Blind, and Dumb, and Deaf to the Cries, and Shreeks, and Wounds, and Groans, and Deaths of their own proper Limbs; in a barbarous drunken rage tear off their own Skin,
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:100687:50"/>Fleſh, and Bones; rive open their very Hearts to let out Spirit, Life, Strength, Soul; hurl one another down to Hell under their Sin, in a deluge of Blood, and worry themſelves by piece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meal into eternal Damnation. And are the Church Digladiations in the Chriſtian World leſs deplorable, when thoſe, whoſe reſpite from ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting Burnings, coſt no leſs than the Blood of God, who are denominated from that moſt ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerable Name, waſh'd in the ſame Laver of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generation, Members of the ſame Spiritual Body, privileged with the ſame moſt excellent Goſpel, and Covenants of Promiſe, and would every one be ready to tear out his Heart, that ſhould dare to tell them, that they ſhall not each poſſeſs the bleſſedneſs of an unſpeakably glorious Heaven, where therefore, as in a Center, they muſt meet, if their hopes fail not: When theſe, I ſay, who thus concenter and agree in their Titles, Royal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and Expectations, are ſo far from combining in the common profeſſion and practice of Unity, Love, Peace, Goodneſs, Vertue, Godlineſs, Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therly kindneſs, Charity, as to grind one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther into Atoms, bite and devour one anothers Hearts, by bloody Animoſities, Reproaches, Rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings, Revilings, Cenſures, Uncharitableneſs, Curſings, Excommunicatings, Fines, Impriſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, Murderings, Maſſacrings, for things ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trinſecal, and foreign to their holy Profeſſion, recommended in the Moſaical, Prophetical, E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vangelical and Apoſtolical Writings. As if God had not delivered Precepts enough to guide Men to Heaven, ever Party muſt have new of its own to torture Mens Conſciences, doubting that there are not Sins enough to damn Men, unleſs we by our whimſies make large additions to the ſum,
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:100687:50"/>diſcovering thereby how much we are affraid, that thoſe, who otherwiſe would ſecurely tread in the Paths of Life, and gain the Crown of Glory, ſhould not ſtumble and fall upon our new created Blocks, and thereby precipitate themſelves into Hell. For what elſe is the meaning of our <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>written Traditions, unwritten Canons, unwritten Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, unwritten Orders,</hi> and an hundred more by the by's; Tricks, and Snares, and Trains, and Traps made to help the Devil more certainly to catch enough. Is not the Holy Word of God, the Scripture, in its Rules and Laws, too oft, too much, too foully-tranſgreſs'd, but the Mouth of Hell muſt be gagg'd and rack'd wider with new devices, that it may be capacious enough to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the numberleſs numbers that we reſolve to ſend thither by man-made Sins, as if it were in deſpite of God. And leaſt our ſelf-deviſed En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins ſhould fail of effecting this, and a poor qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering trembling Conſcience, that looks aſquint at them ſhould chance to preſerve its Innocence and Allegiance to God, and its preſent Light, and Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timents, by ſliping out of or breaking through the Snare, and refuſing to wound it ſelf to eternal Death with the Ponyard we put into its hands; we muſt jog and thruſt home, and drive on its ſlow and cautious pendulous Arm, by the violence of ſuch ſevere indiſpenſible Sanctions, ſo ſtrictly look'd after, ſo rigorouſly executed, and all under a bold pretence of Divine Warrant, that if Men have any thing of Nature, Senſe, and Commiſerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to their own Fleſh, their deareſt Yoke-fellows, their pretty tender innocent Babes, they muſt be cruelly enforc'd to determine to be damn'd for them, or kill their Hearts by dying before their Eyes, under as many Agonies as ingenious Malice
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:100687:51"/>can invent, and this perhaps a thouſand times over, beſide the bequeathing them to the ſame or more miſerable Fortune, and all this is doing God good Service. As if the Lord that bought Mens Souls to eaſe them, <hi>Matth.</hi> 11.29, 30. had done it only to ſell them again to the moſt bloody butchering Fiends to torment them. And God who with ſo much ſeverity prohibits Cruelty, Murder, Bloodſhed by his Laws, had laid in an exception, and given Commiſſion for this, to as many as can ſo diveſt all ſenſe and bowels of Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manity and Chriſtianity, as to judge none to be Men and Chriſtians but themſelves, and inveſt ſo much of <hi>Wolf, Tyger, Dragon,</hi> as to do the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt to make all others <hi>Proſelytes of the Gates of Heil,</hi> like themſelves, when in the mean time Men with the greateſt impunity, may violate the nobleſt Ordinations of Heaven, or upon Proſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on buy off or commute the Penance for a little Traſh and Dirt. Oh dear <hi>Lord Jeſus!</hi> how long, how long ſhall ſuch a Spirit Triumph and ride in Scarlet? How long ſhall they tear in pieces thy People and Heritage, under the Beaſts Skins wherewith they have cloathed them? Oh bleſſed Spouſe of Chriſt! How long muſt thou be af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fronted with the violence of ſuch beaſtly Ruffians, that under a diſguiſe pretend to be thy-very ſelf, that they may the more ſecurely raviſh and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy thee. The Wolf in the Lambs skin un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuſpectedly to devour it. A Beaſt with Horns like a Lamb, but a Voice like a Dragon, <hi>Rev.</hi> 13.11.</p>
               <p>Well, Chriſt's Servants are not <hi>Wolves, Thorns,</hi> and <hi>Thiſtles, Matth.</hi> 7.15, 16. Profitable to none, hurtful to all, publick Curſes: But <hi>Sheep, Vines, Fig-trees,</hi> their Temper, their Behaviour,
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:100687:51"/>their Fruit altogether good, meek, gentle, ſweet, refreſhing, reviving, pleaſing, generally uſeful, publick Bleſſings, like their Maſter every way deſirable, grateful; all being better for them, none worſe, in Goods, good Name, Body or Soul, their Deſigns, their Principles, their Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per and Spirit, their Behaviour and Purpoſe, and Practice being the general benefit of Mankind, and the Church of God; eſpecially that wherein their Lines are fallen. They think it, they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſent it, they indeavour further to make and preſerve it a goodly Heritage. If it hold the Head, if it uphold the main, if its eſtabliſhed Doctrine be truly Chriſtian, if its deſign be true goodneſs, if its Worſhip in the ſubſtance be Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine; They bleſs God for it, they cover its Ble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſhes, they bear with its Infirmities, they fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther its Ends, they endeavour to inlarge it, to adorn it with real Beauties, to vindicate it from Reproaches, to promote its Unity, Proſperity, Peace, Purity, Felicity; lament its Miſeries, Breaches, Corruptions, Defects, Deformities; but expoſe it, but defame it they dare not, they will not. This is a truly Catholick Spirit, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding in all its actings upon truly Catholick Principles: This and this only, when the risk of Partiality, Cenſoriouſneſs, Self-idolizing, Facti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, Fury, Barbarouſneſs, Madneſs, Deviliſm is run will ſtand upon a ſecure baſis, and yeild a Man the bleſſed Fruits of Comfort, Joy, Peace, and Contentation.</p>
               <p>But I muſt come out of the Clouds, and be plain: Therefore ſhall firſt direct what ought to be owned by a Publick Spirit; next what Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples will enable a Man to own what he ought.</p>

Common Humanity engages to be well wiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers to that general Nature which is diffuſed through all the Species, and love that in any Man which I honour in my ſelf. All the Butcheries and Barbarities on Earth iſſue from Mens degene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racy from Humanity into a ferine or diabolical Nature. But ſince I am a Man nothing humane ſhall be foreign to my Cogniſance, to my Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion, to my Ear, to my Conſcience. When the Vices of Perſons give a check to my Bowels, the vertue of the Nature ſhall retrieve their year<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning motions, and when I can ſee nothing in Men to engage, I will endeavour to imitate the beſt of Paterns in taking Arguments from my ſelf. I will not ſo much regard their Conditions as their Capacities, and that in all their Poſſibili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties. If this Nature be perſonally joined to God, why ſhould not I be joined to it in Affection? Shall I tread that Man in the dirt who may ſhine as a Star in the Firmament of Glory? Shall a Companion of Angels and God himſelf, be worſe dealt with than a Devil? May Heaven receive him and ſhall not my Heart? Is God ſo unkind to me as to give me an Example of brutiſhneſs to my own Nature? I muſt not be worſe to him, than I would have him to me, were our circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances changed; the meaſures I meet to him, ſhall I receive of God.</item>
                  <item>2. Chriſtianity next, both renders a man more meet, and lays upon me a further bond, to deſire, endeavour, and effect his good. The honour of the Name, the power of the Thing. The famed Mr. <hi>Fox</hi> could never deny an Alms asked in the Name of Chriſt: but above all the Eternal Father never will, <hi>Joh.</hi> 14.13, 14. and 15.16 and 16.23, 24. But the Nature, the Life, the Power of
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:100687:52"/>Chriſtianity is a Thing incomparable; the higheſt communication of Divine Goodneſs, iſſuing from the loweſt condeſcenſion of infinite grace. Chriſt the God of Wiſdom dwelling in our Nature by the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ghoſt, the God of love, and in our hearts by Faith, to root and ground us in Love. Oh the height, depth, length, breadth, of the love of Chriſt! an Hyperbo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>le to our knowledge, infinitely ſurpaſſing, ſhooting above it, that we may be FILLED WITH ALL THE FULNESS OF GOD. Oh Myſtery above all Myſteries! Oh Grace above all Grace! The Height of moſt incomprehenſible Majeſty, in the deepeſt humility of boundleſs Mercy, exalting poor degenerate man from the loweſt Abyſs of unſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able miſery, to the utmoſt ſublimity of celeſtial Glory, in ſuch an extenſive amplitude, and fullneſs of all the richeſt bleſſings, ſpread abroad over the whole latitude of humane nature, having their ſpring from that everliving fountain of Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Love, and ſtreaming in infinite varleties to the length of all eternity, with ſuch accommodation and ſuitableneſs to every of our particular neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, deſires, hopes, as becomes a fruit of unparal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lel'd incomparable Wiſdom and Grace. Oh un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fathomable Love! thou haſt even outdone thy ſelf, and undone me, a man of an unclean heart, and lips for how ſhall ſuch a poor weak polluted worm be ever able to conceive aright of thy unconceiva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble plenitude; be thankful for, and ſpeak well e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough of thy unſpeakable magnitude; with a degree of Love and delight high enough, entertain thy un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meaſurable ſufficiency, ſweetneſs, and ſatisfactory Perfection; or faithfully improve, and walk wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of, thy unmatchably rich and glorious com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munications. The unſuitableneſs, the unanſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ableneſs of my Spirit and practice will ruine me,
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:100687:53"/>if by another aſtoniſhing Miracle of demiſſion, thou do not ſpread abroad thy quickening, confirming, thy ſanctifying and actuating influences throughout all the powers of my Soul; that in thine own ſtrength, I may rightly glorify thee. That is Chriſtianity in its cauſes; the Wiſdom, Love, and Grace of God, in Jeſus Chriſt: and its general Notion an elevation of Fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len Man to God. More particularly, Chriſtianity in the Theory is the Doctrine of Faith in Jeſus Chriſt; in the Practice 'tis covenanting and keeping Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant with God. This is brief; inlarge your Thoughts thus: Chriſtianity is an undiſſembled acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgement, or owning and receiving Jeſus Chriſt, as the only Mediator betwixt God and man in a hearty Submiſſion to the terms of the Covenant of Grace, Repentance, Faith, and upright Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence. It ſuppoſes Natural Religion, in an univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal ſubjection to the Deity as Creator, Governour, and Owner of all. For if God had nothing to do with us nor we with him, there would be no need of a Mediator; ſo neither if there were no Sin. Hence it alſo ſuppoſes the Obligation of the Law of Nature, which is the Rule of Natural Religion and the guide of man in his natural ſubjection to God. It ſuppoſes alſo the Covenant of Nature (commonly called Works) with the violation of it which none could expiate but God-man. And it includes as moſt eſſential, the Covenant of Grace, and in ſpecial the New Edition thereof, (for the old is Judaiſm) <hi>i. e.</hi> the Goſpel exhibiting Jeſus Chriſt as already come, God in our Fleſh Teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for our inſtruction, Commanding for our di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection, Doing for our example and advantage, and Suffering in our room and ſtead, and for our Sin, <hi>All things neceſſary for our Salvation,</hi> hereby ſatisfying Divine Juſtice and meriting for us the
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:100687:53"/>Holy Ghoſt with his gifts, grace, pardon, peace and eternal glory, to be given us upon conditions and terms ſuitable to his own goodneſs, and our preſent ſtate; <hi>viz.</hi> Repentance toward God, for and from dead works that we might ſerve him the Living God; and Faith in Jeſus Chriſt accepting of, ſubmitting and committing our Souls to him in well doing, with all the fruits hereof, in Love, Meekneſs, Humility, Self-denial, Patience, Heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly-mindedneſs, Watchfulneſs; in Summ, Godlineſs, Righteouſneſs, and Sobriety, to be wrought in us and exerciſed by us, through the Grace and Might of Chriſt which only makes them ſincere and ſound, and ſo acceptacle to God through Chriſt, who a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone intercedes with God on the behalf of Man, for this end, as a Saviour [<gap reason="foreign">

But becauſe the reality of the Heart is only known to God, whereof he never made us the Judges, We muſt proceed ſolely upon the external Profeſſion, as far as it renders the other (real inward owning) credible. Now 'tis in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of this credible owning of Chriſtianity, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſted by Profeſſion, that a Man becomes a mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of the Catholick Church Viſible, has a right to all Ordinances, Baptiſm, Fellowſhip with a parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Church, the Lords Supper, and conſequently Miniſtry, Miniſterial and Fraternal Inſpection, &amp;c.</item>

                  <item>1. There's no Vital Union, betwixt Jeſus Chriſt, and any particular Perſon, merely as a Member of a Particular Church, and under that Formality, but only as a Member of the Church Univerſal in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſible. For There's no union of Life but by un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feigned Faith, uncorrupt Love, which are inviſible things. Theſe make no Man a Member of a Particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:100687:54"/>Church actually, and <hi>ipſo facto,</hi> though they give the firſt and trueſt right thereto; but of the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick they actually do: Nay the Viſible profeſſion of them though it give the right, yet does not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually inveſt in a particular Church, but does in the Univerſal Viſible, and after it has been own'd by the Church in Baptiſm, we are not only Viſible potentially, but ſeen and actually acknowledged Members of the Catholick Church Viſible: yet not preſently of a particular Church. Though Baptiſm be <hi>in</hi> a particular Church yet 'tis not <hi>into</hi> it, but the Univerſal.<note place="margin">Conſent without actual aſſocia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, does not conſtitute any a Member actual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, but only po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentially and virtually.</note> That which makes a Man a Member of a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Church is only Actual Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſociation with its conſent explicit or implicit. Every one that is tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly a Member of the Catholick Church Viſible, and gives any cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dible evidence thereof, either ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicit, or implicit, (as Mr. <hi>Tho. Hooker</hi> truly ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves) and eſſays to joyn himſelf to a particular Church; upon that evidence, ought to be receiv'd to a participation of all Ordinances, and that parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Church cannot <hi>de jure</hi> deny its conſent, but it betrays its truſt and ſins greatly both againſt the man, and Chriſt alſo. But then no man is ſaved under that Formality as a member of a particular Church merely, but only as he partakes of that common Chriſtian Nature, which conſtitutes the Members of the Catholick Church; Though he ſin Grievouſly, and without Repentance general or particular, may juſtly be damn'd, for neglect of joining in the Ordinances with ſome particular Church or other if he have opportunity.</item>
                  <item>2. No man is the Object of our ſpecial Love, as a Chriſtian, merely becauſe he is a Member of a
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:100687:54"/>particular Church: but only as a Member of the Church Univerſal, <hi>i. e.</hi> the particular Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances and Practices that confine, determine, and fix him as a Member, in this or that or the other Aſſembly, are not the firſt Ground and Foundation of my Obligation ſo to Love and do good to him, (although they may add to it) but only Chriſtiani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. And if any think that a Church Covenant, &amp;c. engage to a more ſpecial regard; I anſwer, That is not, becauſe they are a particular Society, ſo join'd nor as ſuch merely, but becauſe Chriſtians. Elſe might the Congregation of Condemners here, <hi>V.</hi> 21, be really obliged to Love one another better than Gods People and Heritage, the Righteous and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent, whom they Perſecuted, but I think 'tis un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deniable, that every one is obliged by the Divine and Chriſtian Law to love a <hi>Good,</hi> better than a <hi>Bad</hi> man, though Confederate with him, in never ſo ſtrict and ſacred bonds of Union and Aſſociation.</item>
               </list>
               <p>I grant that there is an act and fruit of Chriſtian Love proper to Members of Particular Societies, as ſuch, which cannot be extended to Chriſtians at large, Unaſſociated: Or to Speak more Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gruouſly. Since actual Coparticipation of God's Ordinances, is the Formal act of a Particular Church, as ſuch, and this joynt Communion is an Act or Fruit of Chriſtian Love, Depending upon a Condition which Chriſtians are obliged to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form, but oft will and do ſuſpend, though ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times not without Sin; it follows that this Act of Love is not to be extended to thoſe that do not obſerve the Condition. In ſhort, the Condition is Conſent. For Common Chriſtianity, though it do oblige a Man to conſent, to partake of thoſe Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances indefinitely, with any true Church of real Chriſtians; yet it does not confine him to this one
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:100687:55"/>individual, of which I am a Member; but permits him a liberty to chuſe the beſt and fitteſt for his edification, and other conveniencies; yet not that neither, without the Advice and Direction of Chriſt's Officers, or wiſe judicious Chriſtians, or allowance, or connivance at leaſt of the ſupreme Powers Chriſtian, who are obliged to promote and countenance; yea and conſtrain Men by Law, to communicate in God's Ordinances, and by no means permit them to be Recuſants there, I ſay God's Ordinances in general, and as his; for as yet I do not deſcend to conſider them in this, or that or the other particular Mode, Dreſs, Habitude, or way of Adminiſtration. Now except other Circumſtances concur, no Man by me can regularly be forced to communion with me, though he may be exhorted to it. 'Tis not his Duty, but his Freedom, which I cannot conclude, though poſſibly the Magiſtrate may; he muſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine it himſelf, at leaſt if the Publick Laws inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe not; and till he do it though he be in a remote capacity, to be the Object of this Love yet actually he is not the immediate Object of it, but poten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tially only. But if he think to hang off, and will not reſolve one way or other; I look upon it as part of the Magiſtrate's office, to take care that he do live in actual Fellowſhip, with ſome particular Congregation or other. And 'tis conformable to right Reaſon, that the Laws which eſtabliſh this among Chriſtians, ſhould determine men to that particular Society which lies in their Vicinity, <hi>caeteris paribus,</hi> not permitting them to ramble where they liſt, whereby the Law will be eluded: Yet do I not think that 'tis in the Magiſtrate's Power, to compel all the Neighbourhood to parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipate
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:100687:55"/>in all Ordinances, whether qualified or no.<note place="margin">Exhortation be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore receiving the Communion, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </note> There is a bar laid againſt this by an over-ruling for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Law; <hi>viz.</hi> that of Chriſtianity, which the Engliſh Liturgy owns.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The Conſequence of all is, That Publick-Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritedneſs ought to reſpect Goodneſs, and chriſtian Goodneſs mainly, in abſtraction from all Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances of Perſons and Things; and that no Bonds of Relation, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> ſhould further engage our hearts than may be conſiſtent with the general Obligation to own and honour our common Chriſtianity. Thou art a confederate Member of a particular Church, and lookeſt upon thy ſelf as obliged, with a more ſpecial Love to embrace the Chriſtian with whom thou doſt walk in Fellowſhip, I diſallow it not; but can'ſt thou dote ſo much as to think, that thou mayſt be a Heathen to all the world beſide, and they ſuch to thee. No all the Acts of Love which thou extendeſt to the Members of thy own ſociety, are as thou haſt opportunity, to be extended to all that really own Chriſtianity, except only ſuch as prerequire their conſent, and thoſe alſo upon oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion if they regularly deſire it; and all in as true a degree of ſincerity, (though not perhaps in as high a degree of intention,) as if they were of thine own particular combination. 'Tis madneſs to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit that the particular obligations of Chriſtianity, do or can null the General.</p>
               <p>'Tis true ſome men are to be to us as <hi>Heathens</hi> and <hi>Publicans,</hi> but then it muſt be after a due and regular procedure againſt them, According to the tenor of that ſo prudent, ſo equitable, ſo Charitative Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Law, <hi>Matt.</hi> 18.15, 16, 17. But to paganize the whole world unſeen, unheard, un-underſtood, undealt with, is a piece of Charity, which no Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity can Chriſtianize.</p>

Away, away, the Brotherhood comprehends all Chriſtians, is never ſo much as once in the New Teſtament reſtrained to a ſingle Congregation excluſively, when Love is command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to it, or commended when extended to it. 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 4.9, 10. <hi>But as touching Brotherly Love ye need not that I write unto you, for ye your ſelves are taught of God to love one another.

               <p>Upon theſe Principles the old Nonconformiſts <hi>Bradſhaw, Hilderſham, Ball, &amp;c.</hi> and many of the later edition, loved, reſpected, defended, and held Communion with the Congregations in the Church of <hi>England,</hi> where they could as appears by their publick Writings, and known Practice, notwithſtanding the bitter Reproaches and Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures of ſome few, who I wiſh had as well ſtudied the Caſe.</p>

The ſame Chriſtian Doctrine in all the Fundamental Points, the ſame general deſign to promote Holineſs of Life; the ſame Worſhip in the Eſſential form, and matter and means, the ſame Miniſtry, of Perſons ſeparate to perform Divine Offices in the ſame form of Churches, <hi>viz.</hi> Congregational, who are embodied not meerly

And ſhall ſuch things be unpardonable only in the <hi>Church of England,</hi> which judges its own Conſtitution the moſt excellent in the World, and thinks it has as much to ſay againſt you, as you againſt it, as much to ſay for it ſelf, as you for your ſelves, which you can no more convince, than it can you?</item>

               <p>Laſtly, To juſtifie your departure, nothing can be juſtly alledged but fear of Sin in Communion. Now nothing can determine what is, what is not Sin, but God in his Word. You are then obliged to produce Scripture as clear to prove Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a Sin, as 'tis clear from Scripture that 'tis your duty to obey the Magiſtrate in lawful things. For if the Communion which he commands be not unlawful, you ought in Conſcience to obey him in it, <hi>Rom.</hi> 13.5. The General includes the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular. But I profeſs amongſt all the Writings againſt Communion, I have not yet ſeen any one, or more Scriptures alledged, which apart or in conjunction, will evidently and certainly bear ſuch a conſequence. Now turn we the Tables, and bleed a little over poor Sufferers (not as accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing

               <p>It is acknowledged juſt and reaſonable, that all publick Conſtitutions, ſhould be garded with ſtrong impregnable Sanctions, that the honour of the Publick Magiſtrate, which muſt neceſſari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and in Conſcience be upheld, and is as highly concerned in his Laws as any thing, may not be at the mercy of every wanton Head, or waſpiſh Heart. 'Tis the general and acknowledged ſence of all Nations, and has been of all Ages, and (I think of all Perſons) that Religion muſt and ought to be eſtabliſhed by Law. So is the Proteſtant Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion with us and our Neighbours. And there is not a People upon Earth, nor ever was, but would have Religious Concerns kept ſacred and inviolable. Travel through the Proteſtant World alone, and you ſhall experimentally find, that the Church of no Nation, no not of <hi>New England</hi> it ſelf, will endure that its Conſtitution ſhould be diſgrac'd, its Fellowſhip diſown'd, its Worſhip diſavow'd, its Miniſtry diſannul'd, its Diſcipline contemn'd, its Government condemn'd; but will entertain all affronts of this Nature with a ſevere Indignation.

For being brought to the Scriptures with a mind to yield up all the Powers of their Souls to the Mind and Will of God therein revealed, the Holy Ghoſt effectually ſets home the Truths, and Laws, and Threatnings, and Promiſes upon their Conſciences. They have awakening apprehenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the Holineſs and Juſtice of God, the dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful menaces of the Law, the bitter Agonies un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dergone by the Son of God for the Sin of Man, the diſmal Horrors, and Woes, and Cruciations, under the Vengeance of Almighty God in Hell, which makes every Sin very formidable. They are made to underſtand, that although, in reſpect of the matter, ſome Sins are greater, others leſs, yet no Sin is abſolutely little, which is commited a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt a great God; and alſo that ſmaller Sins are aggravated relatively to our Faculties, that 'tis an heinous offence to God, to do the leaſt of Evils, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the clear Light and Conviction of Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, or with a full bent of Will and Affection; and that a Sin, in reſpect of the matter compara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively, and in it ſelf greater, yet is not ſo to me, if committed ignorantly, unwillingly. Under theſe Conſiderations, their own particular Sins are ſet in order before their Faces, ſet on upon their awakned Conſciences, made bitter, and grievous, and odious; that they Day and Night lament over them, are afflicted with them in anguiſh of Soul under them, labouring, and being heavy laden, and able to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain reſt no where, till by ſerions, hearty Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance for, and from them, with a bitter loathing and implacable malice and hatred againſt them, they be prepar'd for, and made willing to embrace the <hi>Lord Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> in his whole mediatory Latitude, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely devote themſelves to him, and his Father in

God is againſt it, 'tis againſt it ſelf; the whole Bible in every Leaf ſpeaks to its Diſcouragement and Dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, and all the <hi>Politicks</hi> in Hell are up in Arms to confound it, with Scruples, Objections, Fears, what not. Oh! the Doubts, the Dolours, the Jealouſies, the inextricable Straits, the Fightings, the Perplexities, the diſmal Apprehenſions, the Deſpairs, the grinding Reflections, the roaring Hell that compaſſes it round about on every ſide; that 'tis a very <hi>Magor Miſſabib.</hi> Really 'twould make a Man ſick to think of it, break his Bones, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 51.8. to feel it.

<pb n="104" facs="tcp:100687:64"/>render it unfit for, and unwilling to engage it ſelf in any Service of God, as fearing to diſpleaſe in all, pleaſe in none. And the Greek Word may ſeem to extend no farther, than ſuch a fear of <hi>Daemons,</hi> which the Heathen World did not underſtand as we, in an infamous ſenſe. <hi>Daemons</hi> with them, were thoſe Bleſſed Beings, that ever lived in Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs, but in an inferiour Station, Souls of <hi>Heroes</hi> and other Spiritual Natures; much what ſuch like as the Popiſh Canoniz'd Saints, and Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors of Interceſſion; to the Noxious Malignant Spirits of the Infernal Regions, they did not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply it: Yet no doubt, the other I have mentioned, are Sins, and may go under this name, in regard of the Affinity they have herewith, according to that common Synecdoche, in every of the Ten Commands. However I am right in terming that over critical fear of diſpleaſing God with little things, Superſtition; as ſuppoſing the Deity was of ſo cheap and eaſie a Nature, as to be bought with Trifles, or ſo tetchy and ſupercilious, as to be loſt and ſold away for ſuch petty Matters, as he would never vouchſafe to take into his Cogni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zance, and concern himſelf to Honour with the leaſt Shadow of an Injunction, but has intirely left to the will and liberty of Man: As if a <hi>Jew</hi> having a Hundred Males in his Flock, without blemiſh alike in their nature and goodneſs, out of which he has a free liberty left him by God, to chuſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny one for Sacrifice, ſhould demur all his days which to take, for fear of offending God, or hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing choſen and Sacrificed, ſhould perpetually vex his Soul with the dread, that his choice has diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſed. This leads me again to the fore-menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned Point. The ſenſe that ſome have of the more eſpecial odiouſneſs to God, of blemiſhes in
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:100687:64"/>his Worſhip. Certainly, of all Sins, thoſe in this moſt weighty Matter, are moſt dangerous: For if that the direct and immediate end whereof is to pleaſe God, and bring me into his Favour, do diſpleaſe him, ſo that I fall under his hate, I am in an evil taking beyond all expreſſion. What ſhall I do, whether ſhall I have recourſe? The Scripture aſſures us that God is moſt Jealous of his Worſhip, and External Worſhip, as the San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction annext to the ſecond Command evinces: and therefore calls the Sin there forbidden expreſsly by the fouleſt name, <hi>Adultery,</hi> the higheſt Violati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Matrimonial Covenant; a Man can bear any thing in his Wife better than that. 'Tis with alluſion<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to this, that the <hi>Lord</hi> ſtiles himſelf a Jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous God. This imports that he hath a peculiar and ſpecial enmity againſt the Violations of the <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Command,</hi> beyond all other, ſince this is affixed to no other. And indeed <hi>Idolatry</hi> may well be ſet in the uppermoſt rank of Sins, becauſe the Exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Woſhip of <hi>Idols</hi> does imply the Internal; to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with the rejection of the true God, which is a Violation of both the Firſt and Third, yea and Fourth Command, as well as the Second: For he that externally adores other Gods, beſides the true, has them inwardly in his beart, and therefore caſts off the Creator of the World; in that he gives him not the Honour of God which is Supreme; takes his Name in vain, ſeeing it has not that due effect upon his Mind and Heart; and therefore cannot <hi>Remember</hi> the Sabbath, as God's Reſt from his Six days Labour, nor keep it Holy to him, becauſe he owns him not in his Soveraign Excellency and Glory. Theſe Conſiderations, with the terrible Executions upon the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> and others, for Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption in the Worſhip of God, as warnings to
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:100687:65"/>us, <hi>Rom.</hi> 10. are of mighty moment, when duly applied; and therefore no wonder, that Men, who have been in bitterneſs for other Sins, do a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove all, dread theſe againſt the Second Command, which God, above all, abhors; no wonder if they be jealous (where God is) of any thing that may ſeem to intrench ſo near, upon the Honour God. Let Men prate and droll what they will againſt ſerious Men, this is certainly the bottom of all their Fears; and that is not a vain Superſtitious Fear which is rightly directed here, but the very firſt principle and beginning of all Divine and Spiritual Wiſdom, and ought not to be diſcoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged and wreſted from Men, by the Power and Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licy of Earth and Hell, which combine to do this, by exciting other Fears, <hi>viz.</hi> of Temporal Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhments. The Damnation of Mens Souls, by acts ſo abominable to the Divine Majeſty, is infinitely more formidable in its ſelf than any thing: And therefore weak frail Fleſh, in which we are oft more ſenſible, ſhould not be tempted and terrifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed into a regardleſneſs of this greateſt of all haz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zards, by any deſigns upon that moſt natural In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct and Law of Self-preſervation; which indeed is madneſs, when it cannot take place, but in the Eternal Deſtruction of the Soul. I ſaid this Fear muſt be rightly directed, that it may not be Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtition: And 'tis ſo, when 'tis graduated ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the nature of the thing, and the Senti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the Divine Majeſty; ſo that what he moſt hates, we moſt fear, and proceed therein, according to the Revelation of God, and let fall our fear where he lets fall his loathing, or reveals nothing of it, for there begins Superſtition. So again, 'tis ill regulated, though we dread to of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend in lighter Matters, poſſibly under Divine
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:100687:65"/>Prohibitions; if yet we regard not the main: For to fear, where no fear is, or to fear more, where leſs fear is; or fear leſs, where more fear is; theſe three are Superſtition. But to fear pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionably to the greatneſs of the Sin, and clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the Light, is not; but a regular fear of God, which he will accept, own, and reward.</p>
               <p>It is not my Province or Deſign, nor Proper to this place, to recite, and plead, or refute and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove the Allegations of either one Party or other; only do heartily wiſh, that I could ſee more of that true Chriſtian Spirit of Love, Moderation, and Meekneſs, on all ſides, which the Goſpel ſo ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly recommends; for Comfort ſhall we find in nothing elſe, when the Account is caſt up at laſt. Church-men, of all others, ſhould be men, of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſionate, ſoft, and tender Hearts; becauſe en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truſted with the Guidance of the tendereſt Part of their People, <hi>viz.</hi> their Conſciences. But tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly I meet it not on any hand, except amongſt a very few: The violent, bitter, irremediable Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judices of the Laity, in every Party, have their Root in the Clergy. 'Tis rare to light on a man of a healing Spirit, which is as a <hi>ſpeckled Bird</hi> when found; the Birds round about are againſt her, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very Man has an Arrow to ſhoot at her, But, Will the end and iſſue hereof be Peace? No, it will not, it cannot.</p>
               <p>Since then, that fear to offend God in the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns of his Honour and Worſhip, which would approve it ſelf not to be Superſtition, muſt be a Branch of that <hi>general Awe and Fear,</hi> which is the beginning of Wiſdom; 'tis abſolutely neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary, that it have a ſure and infallible Light and Guide: For, let not Men think that a fear of of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fending the Divine Majeſty, unpreſcribed by God
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:100687:66"/>in his Word, either in expreſs terms, or by plain conſequence, can ſlip the halter, and get out of the danger of that Scripture, which condemns the Traditionary Man-created Fear of the Scribes and Phariſees, propheſied of by <hi>Iſa.</hi> 29.13. applied by our Saviour, <hi>Mat.</hi> 15.8, 9. See then to your bottom, that ſome plain Scripture teach you to be affraid of diſpleaſing God, by joyning in the Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip uſed by the Church; elſe this very Scripture, which you think makes for you, does really con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn you. For 'tis evident, that ſuch a Fear is a part of that Internal Worſhip, which you pay to God, and if that be unpreſcribed by God, Where are you? But it never can be made evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, I think, that the Church preſcribes any parts or means of Worſhip, unpreſcribed by God; al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though there be ſome things adjoined to the Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, (which is in Circumſtantials allowed by all Parties) that are not commanded, (neither for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid) by God.</p>
               <p>On the other hand, I doubt the Scriptures that are alledged by the Diſſenters, are not ſo tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowly weighed, ſo calmly debated, ſo unpreju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicately examin'd, ſo fully anſwer'd, as they might be; not ſuch a Spirit of Love and Compaſſion, manifeſted in the manage of Diſputes againſt them, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 word">

               <p>Now let it be conſider'd, what Chriſtian Equity and Moderation ſhould be extended to Perſons, whoſe Underſtandings are not omniportant, but Hearts and Conſciences good for the main, and in all the Eſſentials of Chriſtianity; and whether it
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:100687:66"/>does not highly become ſuch a flouriſhing Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Church, ſuch a noble, well-regulated State, to make a difference of Perſons,<note place="margin">

For the Mercies of God's ſake, for the Love of Chriſt's ſake, conſider again and again, how light a matter a Mode or Ceremony is; how heavy a matter Sin is, and let not Duſt and Vanity, be ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lanc'd with Mens Salvation: Say not Contempt of Publick Order is not a light thing, tho' theſe be. Oh condemn not the Innocent with the Guilty: Let thoſe who contemn manifeſtly, and contumaciouſly, ſuffer; but certainly 'tis not Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt in all, but a reverend Fear of contemning the publick Orders of Heaven, which all Men con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs, no Man can order the Violation of. It ſeems clear to many, that to do things required, is for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden by God; they are miſtaken: Grant it, yet they think, not. Their Conſciences ſeem to be reſolv'd, tho' it be in an Error, unknown to them: Therefore to them, 'tis as clear, that no force can be put upon them, no command of man over-rule them, where they judge God has obliged them. They read, they hear, they pray, they ſtudy, and conſider all things, on all hands, as they are able; yet cannot change their minds, tho' it be highly their external Intereſt ſo to do. And ſhall no hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manity be extended to ſuch modeſt, humble, loy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al, patient, teachable Diſſenters, that are ready to engage in all Bonds to live peaceably, in all Oaths to be true Subjects, to ſubſcribe (according to the Act) to the Articles of Religion, abating one or
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:100687:67"/>two Non-Eſſentials, and therefore are of the ſame common Faith; to the Ten Commands, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore agree to lead the ſame godly Life? Are there no Commiſerations for ſuch as theſe? Oh come Lord Jeſus, come quickly; diffuſe abroad that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent Spirit of Love, Unity, and Chriſtianity, which will engage every one of us to judge, that our proper Good is more in the Publique than Our Selves, that the common Intereſt of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, is infinitely more our Concern, than any of our little Bones of Contention, that we may not be cracking Nuts, purſuing after Butterflies, ſmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting our Fellow-ſervants, eating and drinking with the Drunken, when the Heavens begin to crack a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout our ears, and all is ready to be wrapt up in a common Ruine.</p>
               <p>Well, Shall we be Chriſtians, or ſhall we not? Muſt that which will be our Glory and Crown a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove, rule our Hearts and Practices now?

               <p>Let it then paſs uncontroulable, that a Man can never be publick ſpirited, except upon Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples truly Catholick; nor will any other Spirit or Principles, adminiſter ſound, true and ſolid Comfort, and Peace. As the contracted ſhrivling, confining, narrow Temper, begets all the Confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, Broils, Branglings and Blood-ſheds, in the world; ſo it leaves nothing at home in concluſion but dire, ingrateful Reflections, and an horrible Combuſtion of Conſcience; or at the leaſt, In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quietude and Uneaſineſs of Mind; any thing but Satisfaction, Joy and Reſt: Of ſuch Men I ſay, as <hi>Gen.</hi> 49.6. <hi>Oh my Soul, come not thou into their Secret, unto their Aſſembly mine Honour be not thou united.</hi>

Doſt thou not partake of that common Spirit of Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, Compaſſion, Charity, which as good Blood diffuſes it ſelf, and circulates through all the Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of that one Body, ingenerating an univerſal Fellow-feeling, and Care of mutual and general
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:100687:69"/>Concerns in all and every one that lives by the Life of the Head in <hi>Heaven?

See the Apoſtle proſecuting this Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument fully, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.12. to 27. If thou be acted by the private, ſtrait-lac'd, ſelfiſh Spirit of the generality, who can neither give a jot of eaſe to themſelves, under their Perſonal Straits and Sorrows, by a ſerious Reflection on the Welfare of the Church of God; nor will in the leaſt im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitter their Joys with any Conſiderations of the Afflictions of <hi>Joſeph;</hi> ſuſpect thy ſelf to be an A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lien from the Life, and the Catholick Body of Jeſus Chriſt, which ſubſiſts by a Vital Union with him. What now are the Meaſures, by which thou acteſt in thy Station, and with reſpect to the Members of Chriſt? If thou eſpouſe, and tenaciouſly ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>here to, only the Sentiments of ſome Particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Party, or Sect, farewel all publick Spiritedneſs. Thou profeſſeſt a Belief of the <hi>Communion of Saints,</hi> as in one <hi>Catholick Church;</hi> which is indeed an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſible Thing, as are all Objects of <hi>Faith,</hi> in its di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction from <hi>Senſe.</hi> Does this Faith work by Love? Thou owneſt alſo one Univerſal <hi>Body,</hi> ſeen in its parts, viſible in its whole extent through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the World, actually by the Eyes of its Head ſeen in its Unity at once; and potentially by Man. Which is not a <hi>Chaos</hi> of every thing in confuſion, but an Organical Body that in diverſity of uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful comely Members, Parts, Congregations, (the leaſt of the denomination) Countries, and King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms, makes up a lovely Community. Not a Rope of Sand, but a Golden Chain, where e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very

Does thy Fancy or Partiality here make Reſtrictions? Can'ſt thou, dar'ſt thou chop and mangle this Body? Tear off a Limb of this Spouſe? Break the golden Chain for one Link? And dote upon theſe, without regard to the reſt? Can thy Love walk no where but in little Severals, and petty Encloſures? In this ſence, I cannot diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>allow that Saying of a Great Perſon, <hi>viz. That the Church of Chriſt is neither</hi> Rome, <hi>nor a Conventicle:</hi> There may be ſome Part of it there, but confin'd to either it cannot be, excluſively to the reſt of the World. Art thou a Chriſtian? Then muſt Chriſtianity command the freeſt Motions of thy Affections; the Intereſt of that, thou muſt and ſhalt reſpect, honour, promote and love; not as it is pretended, or conceitedly monopolized by any diſtinct Party; but as (like the Sun) it diffuſes its efficiency, vertue and influence every where, and ſhines with a lovely radiancy and glory, in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Man whatſoever. Seeſt thou one, that in the judgment of rational Charity, makes Religion his principal Buſineſs, above all labouring, that it may have a prevalent Intereſt in his Heart? Cleave to this Man, embrace him in thy moſt near, and intimate Affections, be he of what Party ſoever. Doſt thou find any diligently ſearching the Word of God, to know him in all his Perfections, not meerly for Notion ſake, but that his inward Soul and outward Converſation, may be under the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion and Command of what he knows: A Man that maintains a high and honourable eſteem of the ever bleſſed <hi>Redeemer</hi> of the World, the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

A Man that is daily acquainting himſelf, how much it is his Intereſt to live under the Conduct of the <hi>Holy Ghoſt,</hi> and therefore ſtudies his inſpired Writings, to attain right Apprehenſions concerning his Nature, Gifts, Graces, Comforts, that he may aſpire after them, inwardly feel them in their power; and accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly engages his Mind, Will, Affections, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, executive Power, all within and without him, in an univerſal Subjection to this Holy <hi>Trinity</hi> in Unity; and with a reverend Awefulneſs ming<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gled with Love, demeans himſelf under the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of that ever Adoreable Majeſty, as one that hath preſent, powerful Senſations of its im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate Preſence, Overſight, and perfect Cogni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zance, of the moſt ſecret receſſes of his Soul. A man, that underſtanding his relation to God, owns Him, pants after Him with inſatiable Ardour, cleaves unto Him with full purpoſe of heart, in a ſingular Complacency; fears, praiſes, glorifies, truſts, chooſes, embraces, acknowledges Him in all His ways, as His chief Good and Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs; and would not willingly diſpleaſe Him for a World. And having with a Holy, Religious Veneration obſerv'd, approves of, is ſingularly well pleas'd with, that Wonder of all Wonders, the <hi>Grace</hi> of Almighty God, revealed by the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel, in giving His Eternal Son, to be the <hi>Redeemer</hi> of Loſt Mankind; God in our Fleſh manifeſted in the fulneſs of time, to do and ſuffer whatever Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice required, that our Sins might be pardon'd, our Perſons accepted, ſanctified, and glorified.

A Man that in order to all theſe good Ends, diligently examines his Conſcience, ſearches out his parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular ſins, is afflicted, burthened at his very Soul for them, as an Offence to God, rather than his own Damage; uſes all poſſible means to prevail with his Heart to relinquiſh them in its affections, forbearing actually to commit them, lamenting o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, and reforming ſinful Omiſſions, groans un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, and is daily pained with the woful depraved<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of his Nature, his very inward Bent and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination to Evil, the Vanity, as well as Vileneſs

               </p>
               <p>The <hi>Pſalmiſt</hi> then was one that accounted it a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular happineſs to be taught of God: to be throughly inſtructed in Gods law by God himſelf; that is to be effectually brought under the power and led into the practice of Holineſs, whereof the Law is the Rule; for God's Teachings are not only notional and doctrinal, but practical and effective of Obedience. 'Tis all one as if he had ſaid, <hi>Oh the bleſſedneſſes of the man in whoſe heart thou writeſt thy Law,</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by principleſt for and impelleſt to a holy life. This is the Covenant way to Peace. <hi>Iſai.</hi> 54.13. <hi>All thy Children ſhall be taught of God, and great ſhall be the peace of thy Children;</hi> although at preſent thou beeſt <hi>afflicted, toſſed with tempeſt, and not comforted, V.</hi> 11. Oh! this is happy indeed, the very Baſis and Foundation of all Bleſſedneſs; without which 'tis im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible for a Man not to be finally miſerable. No Felicity is attainable if God do not Make his Laws vital Principles in our Souls, which is the tenour of the New Covenant, recited, <hi>Heb.</hi> 8.10, 11. through the exceeding great and precious promiſes whereof, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.4. <hi>We are made partakers of a divine nature, viz.</hi> a living, over-ruling Law within, a tranſcript of the Law eternal upon our hearts, Without Grace there can be no true Peace, without truth no Grace; truth in the light of it to gird up the loyns of our minds, truth in the life of it, the girdle of integrity in our hearts, without Illumination no
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:100687:73"/>Comfort, without Sincerity no Salvation. They muſt combine, and be undivorcedly eſpouſed together, or farewel all true Peace. For to be taught true and ſound Doctrine, and to be led into the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding of all the Divine Commands, though Chriſt himſelf be the Schoolmaſter, (<hi>Luk.</hi> 13.26. <hi>thou haſt taught in our Streets</hi>) will contribute nothing to the happineſs, but much to the miſery of that Man, who never feels the Power of thoſe inſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, renewing his Nature and reforming his Life. But if by the gracious Influences of Heaven, the Precepts of the Law and Goſpel become efficacious, to mould and form us into univerſal Goodneſs, all the divided or joynt Confederations of the Wit, Policy, Power, Virulence, Rage, Malice and Fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, of both the Elements of Miſery, Earth and Hell, to miſchieve us, can never make us really miſerable. Whereof (not to inſiſt upon our bleſſed Redeemer) let <hi>Job</hi> be a Witneſs. Never had Satan ſo large a Permiſſion (not to ſay Commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion) to ſpend all the Artillery of his Madneſs and Malice againſt any Man, that ever we read of, as againſt this incomparable Pattern of Patience; ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver did ſuch a whirlpool of Calamities, ſuck in, and ſwallow up in a Moment, and at unawares any mortal Man ſo ſingled out, before, or after him. All his external Comforts Shipwrack'd, his whole body, from top to toe, an univerſal Ulcer and Maſs of Rottenneſs, except his Organs of Speech, which the Devil reſerv'd in ſoundneſs, for a malicious purpoſe, his end in all the reſt. Nothing leſt him but an <hi>Eve,</hi> the Serpent's Inſtrument to tempt and torture him, <hi>Job</hi> 2.9. and 19.17. The very inward quiet of his mind raviſht way, in ſuch a degree that it did commit a Rape on his bodily reſt, and made all his Comforts and Comforters miſerable, <hi>Job</hi> 6.4.
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:100687:74"/>and 7.4, 13, 14, 15. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Yet for all this, the Man was bleſſed and made a bleſſed End. He was under the ſpecial regard of Heaven, dear to God, under his peculiar care, and fatherly Diſcipline of Love, and therefore not really (although he ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin'd himſelf to be miſerable,) but truly happy.</p>
               <p>On the other hand take an <hi>Ahab</hi> in the affluence of all worldly Delights, Riches, Honours; tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphing in Victory over the moſt potent Kings, 1 King. 20.

Fine and thin ſpeculations, like cobwebs may take, and take with Flies, aery, volatile Wits, and Fancies; but nothing is good in Religion, which does not catch and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vermaſter rational Affections, reduce the will of Man into an Harmony with the Will of God, and better the Life. Oh be not in love with a notio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Religion. Let the Holy Spirit that illuſtrious Ray of Divine Love, reflected upon, and from the Son of Righteouſneſs, deſcend into thy bowels, dwell, and act in thy very inmoſt heart, by his Light to create Life. Be in love with no know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge but that which is of a transforming power, and tendency, that by its vertue thou may'ſt be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely renewed after the Imagine of God.

So alſo it does in the cited places, denote and import an anſwerable amplification in the ſucceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſtate of what was in the foregoing, if it be ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of gradation, as ſure <hi>David's</hi> fearleſneſs would be greater after his deſire was accompliſhed upon his Enemies, than before.

<pb n="129" facs="tcp:100687:76"/>of Bleſſedneſs granted by ſpecial indulgence to theſe to be ſecured from trouble in troublous Times; to have a good day when others (not ſo taught of God) meet with an evil day, to be hid in the day of God's Anger, to be preſerved from the Malice and perſecution of the Wicked. This ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times the Lord vouchſafes to his Children, ſuch like Mercy was promiſed but three Pſalms before, <hi>viz. Pſal.</hi> 91. throughout, ſo <hi>Pſal.</hi> 12.7, 8. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 37. <hi>Iſ.</hi> 26.20, 21, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and many other Places. God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves ſome in ſafety to behold the deſtruction of Perſecutors; has a <hi>Zoar</hi> for a <hi>Lot;</hi> a <hi>Pella</hi> for the Chriſtians, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> If this were not ſo, all Good Men might be extinct, and the Gates of Hell prevail a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Church of Chriſt. 'Tis alſo upon good reaſon. For the end of Affliction is Reformation. If God meet with ſo good Proficients, under his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructive Diſcipline, as will and do learn every Leſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon he teaches, there will be no need of the Rod, and he who does not afflict willingly will not bring into theſe Trials except need be, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.6. But this I will no further inſiſt upon.</p>
               <p>Let the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Tranſlation then obtain, and it gives us this Point, That in the ſenſe of the <hi>Pſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſt, 'twas a bleſſed thing to be under God's correcting Diſcipline, or inſtructive Chaſtenings, as a means to prepare for reſt, when Inſtruments of Divine Severity were to be deſtroyed; Reſt</hi> in this <hi>World,</hi> when <hi>Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment returns to Righteouſneſs, and the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>pright fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low it;</hi> and eſpecially in the World to come, when all the Wicked ſhall be lodged in the <hi>Pit of Hell.</hi> For the days of Eternity are to the Wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed days of Adverſity indeed; and to enjoy Ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting <hi>Reſt</hi> then, is a Bleſſing unutterable. This good Man ſaw nothing in Affliction that could make a Man unhappy. He entertain'd ſuch a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourable
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:100687:77"/>opinion of God's rigours to his Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, that beholding by Faith the good and hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py fruit of them, he admires the Bleſſedneſs of thoſe to whom ſo great Evils iſſue ſo well; and therefore we may juſtly ſuppoſe, would not be diſcourag'd by the bitterneſs of the Croſs, nor driven by it to an unwillingneſs to conſort him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf with the ſuffering People of God. Would not he put in for his ſhare of that Bleſſedneſs, which deſcended from Heaven, though it coſt him a participation of that wretchedneſs, which was the product of the Rage and Fury of the World? <hi>Chuſing rather to ſuffer Affliction with the People of God, than to enjoy the pleaſures of Sin for a ſeaſon; as having reſpect to the Recompence of Reward, everlaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Bleſſedneſs and Reſt,</hi> with <hi>Moſes, Heb.</hi> 11. And indeed this is an admirable Comfort in all Tribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations, to conſider that there is a reſerve of eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Joy and Peace, the ſweeteſt the fulleſt; that there are <hi>Bleſſedneſſes,</hi> the Bleſſedneſs of this Life, the Bleſſedneſs of the Life to come, laid up in ſtore for the Servants of God, though accurſed by Men in this World. If together with the Rod that we feel, he adminiſter a Word that we may hear, <hi>Mic.</hi> 6.9. and under his Correcti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons ſeal our Inſtructions, if by his Providences he ſubdue our Wills to his Precepts, and by the ſad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of our Countenances make our Hearts bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; if he diſcover to us the ſunſhine of his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour and Love through the dark cloud of Afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and bring down a Heaven of Happineſs or Bleſſedneſs to alleviate the tormenting Purgatory of our Tribulations, whether from Men or De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils; this ſure will bow our Hearts to ſuch a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of aequanimous ſubmiſſion and reſignedneſs to God, that we ſhall not only ſit down in a pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:100687:77"/>and quiet Contentation, but be able to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce in the good pleaſure of his Goodneſs, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though we ſmart under it, and he that is reple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed with Content and Joy, is never deſtitute of Conſolation.</p>
               <p>Be not then diſpleaſed O my Soul, that thy Father in Heaven brings thee under the diſcipline of his Family on Earth. If thy Afflictions be light do not deſpiſe or make light of them, if they be heavy and grievous, do not faint under them.

<pb n="134" facs="tcp:100687:79"/>And indeed to ſuch a Man nothing is acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dental; he is never at a loſs for the cauſe of any occurrent, when he has not the leaſt proſpect of the agency of any thing on Earth, he can find out a ſupreme mover in Heaven, to whom nothing falls out by chance, without either the foreſight of his Intelligence, or the conduct of his Wiſdom, or the determination of his Will, or the interpoſal of his Power, or the liberty of his Permiſſion, which though no cauſe at all properly, but only that called <hi>ſine quâ non,</hi> which is but <hi>Fatua,</hi> yet is governed by his Providence, and all the poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilities thereof viſible to his Preſcience. God is more concern'd in the World, than the Artifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer in a Clock, who when 'tis ſet together, ſet up, and agoing, forſakes it. He is ſure little conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant in Scripture, that imagines the Deity only a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral cauſe, who having conſtituted things with ſuch and ſuch particular Natures, Propenſions, Biaſſes, leaves them to run out their courſe without further Concurrence and Solicitude, than to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve them in the being, conſtitution and activity he firſt gave them. There's nothing ſo mean ſo fortuitous, but the Scripture intitles God to it, either in way of Efficiency, Direction, Ordinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, or Permiſſion. If it be Good, Natural or Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral he is the doer; ſo if evil Natural, if evil Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, though he abhor it, cannot effect it, or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cur to it as ſuch, yet can he, does he direct and order it, to ſuch ends, as are conſiſtent with his Wiſdom, Juſtice, Holineſs and Goodneſs; which he well foreknows how to do, therefore hinders not its exiſtence, as he eaſily could do without any violence to Nature, blemiſh to his Government, or infringement of the Liberty of his Creatures. For to me 'tis no little Myſtery, that although
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:100687:79"/>God be able to form a Rational Nature, with li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty of Will and Prudence ſo to manage it, that it ſhall at no time be compell'd to offer violence to its own freedom, but in every act proceed with an even, gentle, ſweet Spontaneity, according to the dictates of its own finite Underſtanding; yet that the infinite Intelligence and Prudence of the Divine Nature, muſt be thought unable and inſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient, by the reaſonable Underſtanding and Will, to elicite, manage and guide theſe very humane Actions ſo as to preſerve the ſame Liberty invio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lable. Let ſomething be allow'd to Infiniteneſs; ſure it can do whatever Finiteneſs can, if it be not to its diſparagement. If I can bring about my own reſolute and fixed Purpoſes, without preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice to my own or others Liberty, ſure boundleſs Wiſdom and Power can tell how to bring about its determinations by the liberty of the Creature. A Reverend Judicious Divine, my Relation, told me, that for experiment ſake, to try the power of an over-maſtering Imagination, he had oft re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſted ſuch things of ſome Perſons, in whom he had no Intereſt at all, which he knew they had an averſation to, uſing no Reaſons, Arguments, Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives, Importunities at all further than the bare propoſal; only engaging himſelf ſtrongly to fanſie, that he ſhould obtain his deſire, and he ſeldom fail'd to prevail. I never had the curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oſity to make a tryal, but am apt to think there may be ſomething in't, upon conſideration of the ſtrange effects of the Mothers imagination upon her enwombed Infant, as to both Impreſſions on its Body, and Antipathies in its Mind; the tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piring animal Spirits, modify'd and mov'd ſtrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by a material Faculty, may intermingle with thoſe of a differing Body, and over-rule their
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:100687:80"/>weaker Modifications and Motions, and thereby the material Faculty that acted them, as in Sym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pathetick Cures, and the votatil Particles of <hi>Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triol, &amp;c.</hi> Crude or calcin'd, do mix with the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>travaſated vital Spirits, and return with them to their Fountain. I confeſs theſe act only as Phyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Cauſes, and cannot vary in their effects of themſelves, though other external Cauſes may thwart them. And what if a Man allow ſome ſuch like thing to Spiritual Natures. By what im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions they can communicate their Minds to one another, by what impulſes they bow one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers Wills; we know not but only the Effects. God never fails to obtain the free voluntary Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience of Angels. And the more determin'd their Wills are the more free. The Devil acts with leſs Liberty than a Glorified Saint; and a Holy Angel, with more than a ſelf-determining Man, who has both liberty of Contrariety and Contradiction, can do both Good and Evil, Act and not Act. Well if my Imagination further, if my ſhort defective Underſtanding can, the one make ſuch impreſſes, the other produce ſuch weighty momentous Reaſons as ſhall ſway my own and others Wills, to an inheſitant and free compliance, ſhall I not give that deference to the unfathomable Intellect and Reaſon of God, as to ſuppoſe it endued with Ability, to ſuggeſt ſuch things, as ſhall bow mine own or others Wills to a ready, ſpontaneous, ingenuous Concurrence, than any thing can, that is deduced merely out of the promptuary of mine own Mind. I find my freedom in acting is gradually more or leſs intenſe, according to the ſatisfaction of my Reaſon. And if the Reaſon of God which is boundleſs cannot induce a more ample ſatisfaction, than the Reaſon
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:100687:80"/>of a Creature which is but lame and imperfect; and if he cannot with as much Facility without all impeach to our Liberty, lead our Minds to the Contemplation thereof, as in the uſe of the em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire our ſelves have over them, we can do; if he cannot alſo more throughly excite, acuminate, quicken and enlarge our conſidering Powers, freely to engage, I have done. 'Tis not ſtrange therefore that the Scripture aſcribes all to God as the Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin of every individual Motion. I find holy Men in every, though never ſo fortuitous an effect, of a ſpontaneous Agent, to look at God. I'll not inſtance in other than <hi>David.</hi> And, 1. for evil Events. As he intimates a poſſibility of <hi>Saul</hi>'s be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing excited againſt him by God, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 26.19. and was foretold that the <hi>Lord</hi> would raiſe up evil againſt him out of his own Houſe, and take his Wives and give them to <hi>Abſalom,</hi> under the notion of his Neighbour, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 12.11. So even when he was curſed by <hi>Shimei,</hi> he owns it as from God, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 16.10. Not that he ſuppoſed God had a hand in the ſin of the Act, but order'd it as a part of the puniſhment threatned for his own Sin. 2. Good Events of all kinds he more fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently aſcribes to God. Does he conquer his Enemies? <hi>'Tis the Lord that lets him ſee his deſire upon them,</hi> Pſal. 59.10. <hi>and ſubdueth the People un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der him,</hi> Pſal. 18.47, 48. See the whole Pſalm; <hi>and ſmites his Enemies in their hinder parts,</hi> Pſal. 78.66. Do his Friends own and anoint and crown him King? He entitles God to it, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 21.3. <hi>When his Father and Mother forſake him, the Lord takes him up,</hi> Pſal. 27.10. Is he ſecur'd in a ſtrong City? <hi>'Tis the Lord's marvellous kindneſs,</hi> Pſal. 31.21. What do I enumerating Particulars? every Pſalm is an Inſtance. And indeed were it not ſo,
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:100687:81"/>
                  <hi>Prayer</hi> would be mere <hi>Mockery,</hi> and <hi>Praiſe Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>criſie;</hi>

                  </note> and that of <hi>Seneca</hi> would be bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter <hi>Divinity,</hi> than we are taught by the Scriptures, (which yet to ſuppoſe is moſt hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ridly Blaſphemous) <hi>Per maxima acto viro turpe eſt etiamnum Deos fagitare.

               <p>Now when a Man does thus in all Events take notice of the Finger of God, and thereby give him the glory of his Efficiency, he is in a diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition for renewed Experiments of the Divine Power and Goodneſs in Peace and Joy. Where the Glory will be given to God he will grant the fulleſt and ſweeteſt taſts of his Graciouſneſs. But who will loſe a Benefit? 'Tis loſt where no like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyhood of any grateful Acknowledgement. Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thankfulneſs is the moſt hateful of Sins. <hi>Ingra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum ſi dixeris, omnia dixeris.</hi> If God muſt not reap Praiſes, he will not ſow Mercies. Not that he needs our Gratitude, but that we muſt own our Benefactor, and teſtifie our advances in Love, when by new Inſtances he teſtifies his Love to us. Nevertheleſs this Love of ours is not profitable to God, but highly (as all other Graces) to our ſelves. Our own Advantage and Intereſt is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way at the bottom of our Duty; which indeed can add nothing to God,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Job</hi> 34.</note> is nothing to him, as neither can our Iniquity de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract from him, or hurt him. His good will to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards us moves him to take care, that it may be well with us, therefore doth he follow us with his tender Mercies, and richeſt Bleſſings, that we may proceed upon ingenuous Motives, in our ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervance of him, and obedience to him; and may not be obnoxious to the check of <hi>Satan,</hi> or our
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:100687:81"/>own Conſciences, for ſervility of Spirit in that work, wherein conſiſts our Liberty, Honour, and Happineſs. Indeed we are not really good if we be not ingenuouſly good; nor act at all for God if we act not from a filial diſpoſition. <hi>Love</hi> is every Grace and Virtue, that Spirit of Life which as an univerſal Cauſe diffuſes its benign animating In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluences, through all the Regions of true Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and Honeſty. All in us that lives to God, every holy Diſpoſition, every gracious Habit, is only a diſtinct particular modification of Love. Even as the varieties of Nature, in thoſe innu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merable differences of Plants, ſenſitive Creatures and Men in their Bodies, are but Earthly Parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles diverſly modified, formed, faſhioned, and qualified. Hence Love is ſaid to be the fulfilling of the Law, <hi>Rom.</hi> 13.10. But without Love to be Good is impoſſible, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13. Where this Grace dwells, God dwells alſo; and the Soul in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpirited by it dwells in God, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 4.8, 16. The more of Love therefore the more of God. He will never be out of our Eye if he be thus in our Hearts. Love there will command our Looks, 'Twas the dominion of this Grace in his Soul, that mov'd the Pſalmiſt to make ſuch honourable men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion here of the <hi>Love and Graciouſneſs of God,</hi> in his aid and ſuſtentation; 'twas this that in his diſtreſs inclin'd him to take Sanctuary in God; and own all the Spiritual Refreſhments that ſola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced his Heart, as derivations from God; and engaged him to devolve all the Glory thereof upon God. And how ſhould that Soul do other that has all in God?</p>
               <p>Haſt thou then, Oh my Soul, evermore and in every occurrent, an Eye toward Heaven, and by thy acknowledgement of the Finger of
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:100687:82"/>God in every thing that befalls thee, Doſt thou honour his Providence, indeavour to reliſh his Goodneſs, and make ſome progreſs in thine af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectionate pantings after him, complacency in him, reſolution for him, and dutifulneſs to him? O let every thing remind thee of his everlaſting Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſeration, that in thy loſt Eſtate remembred thee, gave Blood for thy Ranſom, the Blood of God. <hi>Acts</hi> 20.28. <hi>The time of thy lothing was the time of his Love,</hi> Eze. 16.5, 8. <hi>He loved thee out of the Pit of Corruption,</hi> Iſa. 38.17. <hi>He hath prevented thee with the Bleſſings of Goodneſs,</hi> Pſal. 21.3. <hi>He redeemeth thy Life from Deſtruction, and crowneth thee with loving Kindneſs and tender Mercies,</hi> Pſal. 103.4. <hi>He hath not dealt with thee after thy Sins, nor rewarded thee accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to thy Iniquities,</hi> ver. 10.

                  <hi>The Pſalmiſt was a Man, who diſcern'd ſuch an emptineſs, and inſufficiency in all inferiour Content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, as to ſeek no relief from them, nor take up with any in them, as his reſt in Trouble; but in deepeſt an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xiety and diſtreſs, did look for, and find all his comfort ſolely in and from God:</hi> This is the very ſubſtance and marrow of the Verſe. Indeed the whole Pſalm is a Teſtimony of his ceaſing from the
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:100687:82"/>Creature, from Man, in a believing and affectio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate recourſe to God: Where-ever he caſt his Eye upon Earth, the Inſcription was Vanity and Vexation. A deluge of Sin and Miſery covered the World, that like <hi>Noah</hi>'s Dove he could find no reſt for the ſole of his Foot below, therefore does he direct his courſe toward Heaven. Thus <hi>Pſal.</hi> 55.6. <hi>Oh that I had wings like a Dove, for then I would flee away and be at reſt:</hi> But Reſt is not a Denizen of this World. Nothing but the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven of Heavens is at reſt, and here does he fix on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. There was a <hi>Windy Storm and Tempeſt</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out, as <hi>Pſal.</hi> 55.8. and which is worſe, a Tumult and Combuſtion within in his thoughts.

If he be out of the reach of all the <hi>Blood-ſuckers</hi> on Earth, and all the Furies in Hell; yet be dog'd and haunted with his own turbulent, ungovernable Cogitations, he needs no other Tormenters.

Here is his <hi>Eaſe</hi> in the Torment and Mutiny within; <hi>thy Comforts de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light my Soul.</hi> Nothing can really comfort without God, or any further than as it leads to God. The Creatures are but dry Breaſts and a miſcarrying Womb. The empty Ciſterns will ſooner be filled with the Tears of the diſappointed Hopeleſs, than diſtil upon, or repleniſh and fill their Souls, with
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:100687:83"/>the refreſhing Dews of true Conſolation. 'Tis in vain to look for living Comforts amongſt dead Enjoyments. There's no Life or vital Influence in any thing, to enable it to quiet a troubled Soul, if God be not in it: He is the Soul of all real Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment. In Separation from him there can be no Heaven; <hi>i. e.</hi> no Life, no Peace, no Reſt, no Glory; all's only Dream and Fancy, and will va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh into Smoak and Fire; yet ſuch as is outer Darkneſs: And if without him, there can be no Heaven above, much leſs below in the mind of Man, leaſt of all in the outward Objects of Senſe, and carnal Affection, which the Men of the World make their gods and adore. Truth is, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever they pant after and love in the Creature, is a Shadow, a Counterfeit God. I was going to ſay, even that which they wickedly dote on be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, is only a preſumptive Excellency of God: For no Appetite can be taken with Evil, as ſuch; it never ſolicits us in its own form, but only in the diſguiſe of goodneſs. Real, it has none it ſelf, therefore is only good in a Vizor, or Mask like a Devil in the habit of an Angel of Light. <hi>Omne malum fundatur in bono:</hi> When it wooes our Affections it brings ſome viſible or apparent good, to ſpeak for it as being in it ſelf likely to meet with nothing but abhorrence. The apparent good is Pleaſure, Profit, Honour, the Worlds Trini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; theſe are the Baits to our Affections. Now the perfection of theſe is Heaven, and God: pure and undroſſy Pleaſure, and fulneſs of Joy, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 16. ult; ſolid and immarceſſible Treaſures, Riches, and Gain, <hi>Matth.</hi> 6.20. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6.19. <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 3.8. <hi>Phil.</hi> 1.21. <hi>Luk.</hi> 12.33. <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.4. and 9.22. and 11.3. <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 1.7. and 2.4. <hi>Phil.</hi> 4.19. <hi>Subſtanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al and Royal Honours;</hi> whence God ſo often is ſtil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:100687:83"/>a King, and Heaven a Kingdom, into which all that are admitted are Crowned as well as the King himſelf. In ſhort, God is the moſt pleaſing, yea infinitely pleaſing, profitable, honourable, honouring Good; the Fountain of all Honour. 'Tis true, the Profits, Pleaſures, and Honours of this World are quite of another <hi>Genius,</hi> Senſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive and Senſual, not Rational and Spiritual: Yet I hold, that if the Spiritual Bodies in Heaven, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.44. be endowed with Senſe as 'tis pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable (<hi>Job</hi> 19.26, 27. <hi>Rev.</hi> 1.7. Seeing will infer the reſt, External and Internal) even ſenſe it ſelf will receive in Heaven and God, and the moſt ample Raviſhing Satisfaction, in all its poſſible Capacities, both outward and inward, in Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſation for all thoſe Mortifications and Miſeries, wherewith it hath been Cruciated in this Life, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven as the Body in Hell, in all its ſenſible Poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilities is Tormented, as a juſt Recompence for its Communion with the Soul in all ſinful Senſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alities. Indeed the ſinful Senſuality ſhall not, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not have place in Heaven: Not a Man there will deſire it, not one need it, but all Everlaſtingly ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hor it. 'Twould be the moſt unſpeakable Torment to thoſe Spiritual Bodies and Divine Souls. The Body there does not ſo much affect the Soul, as the Soul the Body, and God both. The Spring of all Satisfaction is in God, derived from him to the Soul, from the Soul to the Senſe and Body; and whatever Senſe does introduce is of the ſame alloy and quality. There can be no Senſations of Delight in any thing, but what is really refreſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to thoſe pure ſinleſs Spirits: What things ſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver would be diſguſtful to the Sanctity of the Soul, would therefore be Torturous to its ever Sympa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thizing Individual Companion, the Body; which
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:100687:84"/>Torture, ſince 'tis utterly Incompatible with Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven; hence carnal Senſualities are there abſolutely impoſſible. But then Spiritual and Metaphorical Senſualities are the very Life and Soul of Heaven, perceptible by the Spiritual Body, as well as the Soul: I cannot exclude all Natural. The Body in all its Poſſibilites of ſenſe will be in a perpetu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al raviſhing, rapturous Ecſtacy of Delight, through the overflow of thoſe Coeleſtial Joys, which ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more ſolace the Soul, in the Embraces of eternal, infinite Love and Goodneſs. I have had a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit, which I ſubmit to better Judgments; thus I expreſt it, Chriſt comes in Flaming Fire, 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 1.7, 8. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 50.3. which ſhall conſume the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terial Heavens, as well as the Elements and Earth, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.7, 10, 12, and is deſigned for <hi>Vengeance to thoſe that know not God, and obey not the Goſpel;</hi> 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 1.8. <hi>and Perdition to ungodly Men,</hi> 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.7. Now his Saints, <hi>Jude</hi> 14. <hi>Zech.</hi> 14 5. as well as Mighty Angels, 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 1.7. ſhall come with him, which I underſtand of Glorified Souls, to meet and be rejoyned to their raiſed Spiritual Bodies. Upon theſe Bodies that Fire ſhall have no Power; to them it ſhall be no Torture and Cruciation, it ſhall only be refreſhing Light to them, tormenting Fire to the Wicked. The Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies of both ſhall be raiſed Incorruptible, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.52, 53. The Fire ſhall torment, but not cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt and conſume the Bodies of the Damned in Hell it ſelf. God, Chriſt and the Saints dwell for ever in Light unapproachable, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6.16. <hi>Col.</hi> 1.12. and the Light wherein Chriſt appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to <hi>Paul,</hi> was greater, more glorious than that of the Sun at Noon-day, <hi>Acts</hi> 26.13. elſe could it not outſhine it. This ſingularly Intenſe Light of Heaven is queſtionleſs, an unconceivable, even
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:100687:84"/>ſenſitive Pleaſure to the Saints refined Bodies. Now this is my fancy, ſince Light is delute Fire, the Sun its Fountain a vivid Flame; yet everlaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Light in its higheſt Perfection, is one of the Pleaſures and Delights of Heaven, being the Roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Robe of the Divine Majeſty, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 104.2. And his Angels are a flaming Fire, therefore called <hi>Seraphims,</hi> from their Fiery Splendor and Glory, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 104.4. <hi>Heb.</hi> 1.7. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 6.2, 6. yet Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter to our good, even in that form <hi>Iſa.</hi> 6.6. <hi>Heb.</hi> 4.14. Hence may it not be inferr'd that the fram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Fire in which Chriſt appears, will be ſo far from being hurtful, painful to his, and their glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified Bodies, as to be an object of ſpecial Senſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Delectation, and cauſe a pleaſurable refreſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment wonderfully grateful, to thoſe Celeſtial Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, which ſhall dwell for ever in, and be cloath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the Eternal Light of Heaven: That if it were poſſible for a glorified Saint to be hurried in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the material Fire of Hell, 'twould not be hurt; or for a Damned Wretch to be led through Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, the Light thereof to him would be torment<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Fire: But this I leave in <hi>Medio</hi> as a Speculation perhaps too curious. I queſtion not but that the Almightineſs of God, which is engaged to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote to the utmoſt, the happineſs of the Saints, can make thoſe things, that now to the Body are moſt painful, to be then moſt pleaſureful; that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven in its Phyſical Conſtitution, as well as Moral, it ſhall be delighted with that which is diſtaſtful in this Life, if it be not ſinful. And poſſibly <hi>Adam</hi>'s Body in its Primitive Innocent Eſtate of Creation, might be of the ſame Conſtitution, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vulnerable, incombuſtible, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> as far as was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite to his ſecurity from Death: For I cannot ſo much as implicitly impute ſuch Colluſion to the
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:100687:85"/>Divine Majeſty, as to imagine that he only threat, ned <hi>that,</hi> as a Puniſhment of his Sin, which was the condition and neceſſity of his Nature. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther will I deny that the Tree of Life was a Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament of Immortality: But conceive that, nor he, nor it could be ubiquitary or inſeparable; nor do I think that the Deity obliged himſelf to a Providence reſpecting innocent Mankind, which would have been a perpetual ſeries of Miracles, ſince 'twas as eaſie with God to make Impaſſibility an amiſſible Condition of this Nature, as Immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality: But I am not Determinate here neither.</p>
               <p>However the Elevated Senſe of that Immortal State above, will be abundantly pleaſured with Super-natural and Super-ſenſual Gratifications, in the Jucundity, Profitableneſs and Honour of Heaven; the vain and empty Shadows whereof, engage it in endleſs Purſuits, during this its De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate ſtate on Earth. The Generoſity and Nobleneſs thereof will be ſo Tranſcendent, that it cannot but entertain with Indignation, Scorn, and Horror; all imaginable Solicitations to any thing ſinfully Delightful, Commodious and vain Glorious: Every thing to it being as it ſelf, Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>limated into a Spiritual and Celeſtial Nature, that it enjoys the ſweet of all without the ſowr, in an unfading Quinteſſence of moſt exquiſitely delici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Contentments: where although there can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver be any troubled Thoughts, yet may we ever ſing, <hi>Thy Comforts, Oh Lord, delight my Soul.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Then, Oh my Soul, delight thou thy ſelf in, and with them alone; and not meerly as in the Streams, but in the Well-ſpring it ſelf. Own God in every inferiour means, but reſt no where except in God Oh do not in a pompous Dreſs of Shadowy deluſory Satisfactions, cheat thy ſelf

Where thy Faith it ſelf ſhall be converted into Senſe, Sight and Taſte, in a never ending Poſſeſſion, of what Eye hath not ſeen, nor Ear heard, nor hath en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred into the Heart of Man to conceive.

<pb n="149" facs="tcp:100687:86"/>mayeſt lawfully or ſinleſsly receive from the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, as ſo many ſteps to mount upon, and aſcend towards the Spiritual Contents of <hi>Heaven;</hi> neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitated to uſe every good thing below, as a <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrancer</hi> to thee of its Perfection in God, that it may blow up thy paſſionate Aſpirations, into a more vehement and inextinguiſhable Flame and Ardour toward him. In all things thou mayſt taſte that the Lord is <hi>Gracious,</hi> and enjoy ſweet and comfortable Prelibations of Heaven. This is thy privilege: But on the other hand thou art prohibited to make a God of this World, and Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice the Creature to thy Senſe or Senſuality. To be happy in Exteriour Things relatively to God, making a Deference to him, whenever that which he hath ſhed abroad of his Goodneſs upon them, meets with thine Appetite in any agreeable Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony, is a part of Happineſs indulged to Morta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity; but to hunt after Senſitive Pleaſure for plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures ſake, and Profits for profits ſake, and Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours for honours ſake; taking up an abſolute Reſt in them, as if the ultimate end of Life, and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancing them to a Competition with, if not Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference before all-ſufficient Goodneſs, this is the greateſt Debauchery of Humane Nature, a ſtep of Degeneracy below the <hi>Diabolical.</hi> For, though the Temperament of this, admit of ſome hot and dry, fiery and aery Sins; as <hi>Pride, Revenge, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice,</hi> &amp;c. yet does it not of all the Four Elements of Senſuality, <hi>Fiery Luſt, Aery Ambition, Watery Drunkenneſs, and Earthy Covetouſneſs,</hi> againſt which, Oh my Soul, it concerns thee to Fortifie and Arm thy ſelf, with the contrary Elements of <hi>Godlineſs,</hi> viz. <hi>Watery Repentance, Earthy Humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, Fiery Zeal</hi> and <hi>Love, Aery</hi> or <hi>Aethereal Hope,</hi> and <hi>Heavenly Mindedneſs,</hi> and that which as the

The Divine Majeſty can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not with patience endure to be caſt in the Balance with Vanity; 'tis a high affront and diſparagement. And, what is it, that in thy Appetite doth ſo oft Counter-balance the Felicity to be enjoy'd in him? <hi>Behold</hi> and <hi>Judge:</hi> The whole Earth is but as an inviſible indiviſible Point to the Heavens; What is it then to God?

                  <hi>CHAP.XI.</hi> The Nature and Quality of the Pſalmiſt's Thoughts.</head>
               <p n="2">2. I Have obliged my ſelf next to give ſome ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of the Thoughts, the excellent Pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man of this Pſalm thus decyphered, was cumbred with, under which he could find no redreſs on this ſide Heaven. In this Inquiry we ſhall gain little aſſiſtance from the proper ſignification of the Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal Word. It is but by gueſs that Interpreters render it <hi>Thoughts,</hi> no neceſſity from either the Word it ſelf, or the ſcope of the two places where 'tis uſed, [here, and <hi>Pſal.</hi> 139.23.] does de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine it for Thoughts properly ſo call'd, any more than other Actings of the Soul. Of the Inclinations of the Affections, of the Will, it may be underſtood as well as the Mind and its Moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:100687:88"/>Any thing proceeding from any of the Facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and Powers of the Soul, that reſembles the Branchings of a Tree, whether it appertain to the Head or Heart, or both, may be included in the ſenſe of it. Therefore we muſt not exclude any thing within, deny no workings either of Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding, or Appetite, or Conſcience, to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertain to the meaning of the Word.</p>
               <p>But ſince the Tranſlation confines us to <hi>Thoughts,</hi> and the Original inforces no ſenſe but what re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates to the Phyſical quality of ſuch like operati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the Mind in general, which reſemble the Ramifications or ſpreading dividing Branches of a Tree; whereas 'tis their moral Nature we are chiefly concern'd about in this diſquiſition; hence are we again put upon a ſearch into the Context, and Scope of the Pſalm, and the Pſalmiſt's preſent caſe, that we may obtain a more clear and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct <hi>Idaea</hi> of them. Now I take it for granted, that in ſome part or other of the Pſalm, theſe Thoughts are expreſt in Words, or at leaſt plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly imply'd and hinted. Therefore ſhall I ſurvey it as impartially as may be, to find them out and not clog my Diſcourſe with Impertinencies.</p>
               <p n="1">1. In <hi>General,</hi> The Thoughts were ſuch as in their Nature did enforce a neceſſity of Comfort, and that from God himſelf, as the Text evinces. There ſeem to be inſinuated a contrariety betwixt his Thoughts and Comforts; that the latter were abſolutely needful to antidote the former. Had they been good and delightful cogitations, they would have carried a ſpring of Satisfaction in their own Bowels. Had they been ſinfully evil, he would not have ſaid, <hi>IN the multitude,</hi> &amp;c. which ſuppoſes a continuance of the Thoughts, even whilſt the Comforts were apply'd as a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:100687:88"/>to remove the Malignity of them. But ſinful Thoughts are not to be oppos'd with Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts, that will permit them to continue; but with Contrition, Repentance, Grace, Converſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, Holy Thoughts, which will immediately eject and diſcontinue them. Yet may I admit that the Thoughts might be ſuch as were occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on'd by Sin; Sin might be the object of ſome of them, the cauſe of others, yet the form of none.</p>
               <p>They were without all peradventure Uncom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable, Undelightful, Unpleaſing Thoughts; therefore does he derive his Comforts from ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Sourſe and Spring. His Thoughts though a broad ſpreading Tree with multitudes of Bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, yet did not bear a dram of this Fruit. No he never looks for it there, but ſteps into <hi>Paradiſe,</hi> and takes it from the <hi>Tree of Life. Thy Comforts.</hi> We therefore will ſuppoſe, that they were not ſuch as did corrupt his Mind, but diſquiet it; ſinleſs they were, but ſaddening; they induced no guilt, but only Grief; they did not avert his Mind from God and Goodneſs, but only from Peace and Reſt; ſinking it into Diſconſolateneſs, till he took Sanctuary in the Refreſhments of Heaven. The Text plainly intimates that if he had not found ſome effectual help in theſe, his Thoughts would have been an overmatch for him, and have born him down. Therefore <hi>Afflicting they were but not Defiling.</hi> This was their General Nature.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Particularly,</hi> They were of the nature of Meditations, <hi>i. e. Heart-affecting Thoughts.</hi> Not mere Speculations, or notional Thoughts that were confin'd within the boundaries of his Mind, and Underſtanding; but Thoughts that ſunk downwards and produc'd ſome effects on his
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:100687:89"/>Soul. For ſince no Thoughts are afflicting to us, but only as they work upon thoſe Paſſions of our Minds, which are of a turbulent tormenting Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; hence it appears that theſe had an influence upon his <hi>Iraſcible Affections,</hi> (as by a <hi>Synecdoche</hi> they are call'd) repreſenting to them ſome Evils from which they could not but retire in an hoſtile averſation. For no Evils without us cruciate us, till they thus get within us, and fight us by our own Paſſions. This is the <hi>Beelzaebub</hi> that poſſeſſes us, and creates a Hell in our Minds, even our maſterly imperious Appetite. The Thoughts that create a tumult here, are as ſo many Fiends to torture us. That rebel rage which they infuſe into our Blood and Spitits, diſorders, diſcom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes our whole Man, and makes us Devils to our ſelves. Thoughts then they were exciting Paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. Therefore we muſt ſearch and conſider what Paſſions in particular were in a civil war within the <hi>Pſalmiſt,</hi> and alſo the quality of thoſe Evils which excited them. And that I may not be neceſſitated to repeat things over and over, as the more natural Synthetical way and method of enquiry (firſt after the Objects here particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly ſet down, thence concluding the general Acts which only are implyed) would compel me: I ſhall chuſe the <hi>Analytical</hi> rather, propoſing firſt the General Paſſions, converſant about the nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous ſpecial Objects, which ſhall reſpectively be referr'd to their general and proper Heads, toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with ſuch as are of Affinity therewith, though not expreſt in the <hi>Pſalm.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Thoughts then were of three kinds, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwerable to three Affections, which were vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mently moved by them, <hi>viz. Fear, Grief, Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pair.</hi> Any one of theſe alone is torturous, but
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:100687:89"/>altogether intolerable. Grief pains our Hearts as an oppreſſing load, waſts and waſhes away thoſe Spirits that ſhould ſupport us, weakens and effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minates our Minds into an inſufficency or unwil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingneſs to regard any thing, but what will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute to its own exceſſes, till as an impetuous Torrent or Deluge it overwhelm our Soul and Spirit, and ſometimes deſtroy the Body alſo; and herein it is more anguiſhful than Fear, becauſe the Evil preſent and felt ſtings more cruelly, than when only foreſeen in its Cauſes; the Senſe pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenting many things to torment us, which before our Fears were not privy to; even as Fear ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times repreſents Evils more terrible than they are in reality found to be. But now if to the preſent troubleſome Experience, be adjoined a dreadful expectation of worſe to come, or more of the ſame kind, this will double the torture, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it doubles the perturbation, and further be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trays the ſuccours which Reaſon or Hope might adminiſter to us. But if to both theſe be ſuperad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded an abſolute hopeleſsneſs of relief that we ſee, and foreſee, and feel our ſelves miſerable, without any likelyhood of Redemption, that ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther our Reaſon is darken'd by the ſuffuſion of our Paſſions, ſo as not to be able to gain a proſpect of remedy, or the magnitude of the Evil it ſelf is altogether invincible; this ſtrangles Nature, and makes it ſink under its deſpondencies, into a Hell upon Earth. Of theſe Fear is the firſt and light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt, and many times comes ſingle. For whilſt an evil is at a diſtance there's a poſſibility to prevent its actual incurſion. But Grief does often ſucceed the torment of Fear, as when the evil does not ſurprize, but gradually invade us, and this is like a new Wound in an old Sore, therefore does
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:100687:90"/>more ſmartingly gall us. Yet both theſe together are nothing to Deſpair, which is a compound of the other two, beſides what it brings of its own to make a Man inexplicably, unſupportably miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>Fearing Thoughts,</hi> terrifing Imaginations are bloody Tormenters, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 4.18. and tear the Soul in pieces. When an Evil is imminent and we are conſcious of an inability to avoid or reſiſt it, our Spirits ſuccumb, ſink, and in a pale horrour retire, and run away from the approach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing danger. For ſome kind of danger is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly the object of Fear, which is excited when the Mind apprehends, and the Thoughts dwell upon the greatneſs, nearneſs, or unavoidableneſs of the Peril. The danger in the <hi>Pſalmiſt</hi>'s Thoughts ſeems to be double, <hi>viz.</hi> of two the greateſt evils <hi>Sin</hi> and <hi>Death.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. Of Sin: for of that (under Correction) I interpret, <hi>ver.</hi> 18. <hi>When I ſaid my foot ſlippeth, &amp;c.</hi> The Expreſſion is but thrice beſide, that I find in the <hi>Pſalms,</hi> and in two of them 'tis evident that a moral ſlipping or ſliding into Sin is meant, and the context gives fair probability for the third alſo, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 17.5. <hi>Hold up my goings in thy paths, that my footſteps ſlip not,</hi> that is, <hi>that I ſin not,</hi> Pſal. 38.16, 17, 18. <hi>When my foot ſlippeth they magnifie themſelves againſt me, For I am ready to halt, and my Sorrow is continually before me, For I will declare my Iniquity, I will be ſorry for my Sin.</hi> Theſe 3 Verſes are connected cauſally; I know not how to make ſence of them, if the ſlipping and halting be other than the ſinning he ſorrowed for. I take Sorrow in the latter clauſe of the 17. <hi>ver.</hi> not formally, for the Paſſion of Sorrow, but materially and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jectively for the thing he ſorrowed for, <hi>viz. his
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:100687:90"/>Sin;</hi> and ſo account this an equivalent Expreſſion with that <hi>Pſal.</hi> 51.3. <hi>My Sin is over before me:</hi> And this is not an unuſal thing in Scripture for Affections or Actions to be put for their Objects or Effects, as in that very <hi>Pſalm ver.</hi> 3. <hi>There is no ſoundneſs in my Fleſh becauſe of thine Anger,</hi> i. e. the effects of thine Anger. And <hi>ver.</hi> 9. <hi>Lord all my deſire is before thee,</hi> i. e. the objects of my de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire, the things I deſire. However the Sorrow there was for <hi>Sin, ver.</hi> 18. and ſo the Sin was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him, immediately in the Sorrow. I account that the Clauſes of thoſe two Verſes anſwer one another thus, <hi>I am ready to halt, for I will declare my Sin,—</hi> I'll not deny the Truth though it give advantage to my Adverſaries, and occaſion their magnifying themſelves againſt me. I find my ſelf oft liable to fall into Sin, I acknowledge it, let them make the beſt and worſt they can of it, and triumph as they pleaſe. <hi>Only do not thou forſake me,</hi> ver. 21. <hi>Hear me,</hi> ver. 15, 16. <hi>ſo as to uphold my goings, that though I fall I may not be utterly caſt down,</hi> Pſal. 37.24. The third place is a perfect parallel to this here, <hi>ver.</hi> 18. and ſo alſo in many things is the whole <hi>Pſalm.</hi> 'Tis <hi>Pſalm</hi> 73.2. <hi>But as for me, my Feet were almoſt gone, my Steps had well-nigh ſlipt: For I was envious at the Fooliſh, &amp;c.</hi> This ſeems a plain indication, both of the nature of the ſlip that 'twas moral, a ſlip into Sin, and alſo of the kind of the Sin, into which he was ready to ſlip, or did ſlip, either <hi>Envy</hi> or ſome effect thereof. To Interpret it of ſlipping into Suffering appears very incongruous, the whole ſcope repudiates it. For ſuppoſe he thought him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in danger of Death, as we ſhall ſee our <hi>Pſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſt</hi> was, and intended in this <hi>Metaphor</hi> to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare it thus, <hi>I had almoſt ſlipt into Deſtruction. For
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:100687:91"/>I was envious,</hi> &amp;c. This ſounds harſhly to ratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Ears; the reaſon of the coherence muſt be far fetch'd, and ſuppoſe our ſenſe ere the illati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on will hold, as thus, <hi>That Envy is a Sin, and Sin expoſes to Deſtruction;</hi> but this plainly ſuppoſes that the firſt ſlip muſt be into Sin, as we Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pret. Why then go we about the Buſh? The Origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Word where it is not tranſlated ſlip, doth oft ſubmit to a ſence, through the force of the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter 'tis apply'd to, which imports ſome thing of Sin, as <hi>Pſal.</hi> 82.5. <hi>All the Foundations of the Earth</hi> [<gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>] <hi>are out of courſe;</hi> Nod, ſlip, are moved out of their due moral courſe of Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs in which they ought to move. <hi>Pſ.</hi> 55.3. [<gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>] <hi>They ſlip, move, caſt Iniquity upon me,</hi> that is, they lay it to my charge, which with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Iniquity they could not do to the Innocent.</p>
               <p>I confeſs there's nothing in the Context to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>force this moral ſence, ſo neither is there any thing to urge the other. It lies indifferent to both. Therefore 'tis but rational to apply that ſence to it, which other places neceſſitate. For why muſt a new ſence be impos'd upon an old Phraſe here only, when there's nothing to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrain it? Let it therefore imply 'tis fear of fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling into Sin, his ſence of a Temptation to it, as <hi>Pſal.</hi> 73.2. That very Sin there inſinuated, ſeems to be in the <hi>Pſalmiſt's</hi> Eye. Help failed him on Earth, <hi>ver.</hi> 16, 17. Iniquity was triumphant, <hi>ver.</hi> 20, 21. and Innocency trampled on; this touch'd him to the Quick, and was the ground of his Plea, <hi>ver.</hi> 20. He therefore ſeems to be inclin'd to envy that Proſperity, wherein they flouriſh'd, whilſt himſelf was in a condition full of trouble, fear and hazzard; and yet being aware of the Temptation, he flies to God. <hi>Oh! my Foot ſlips,
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:100687:91"/>I am like to be born down with the violence of the ſug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſtion, help Lord, and ſuſtain me, that I may not ſin againſt thee and my own Soul.</hi> The Temptation had in ſinuated it ſelf into his Thoughts, but had not obtain'd the conſent of his Will, <hi>that</hi> riſes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt it, and calls in the aid of Heaven, and God is merciful to him ſo as to relieve him.</p>
               <p>To this Head therefore may I refer all the diſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolate Thoughts, that ariſe in the Hearts of God's Servants through the ſuggeſtions of <hi>Satan.</hi> Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ordinary Temptations, or thoſe extraordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſudden Injections, which ſtrike a dread and horrour into the Mind, and are ſo far from ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſhing its conſent, that it riſes in Indignation, Enmity, and Abhorrence againſt them, and would give Worlds to be freed from them. As <hi>Athe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſtical, Blaſphemous, Execratory, &amp;c.</hi> thoughts of God, Chriſt, the Holy Spirit, the Scriptures, Providence, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Theſe though in the matter of them, they be more abundantly enormous than common Temptations, yet have proportionably a greater check from the Will, which in a more violent Antipathy ſets it ſelf againſt them, and therefore, though they be more our Trouble, are leſs our Sin, than ſuch as with more freedom are entertain'd into our Minds. For if it were a ſin to have evil ſuggeſted outwardly, or from a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil without us in the groſs way of Temptation, whilſt our Hearts abominate it, the ſinleſs Lamb of God would not have been free; ſo neither when inviſibly and inwardly; ſince even external Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſals cannot be underſtood and known, without inward Thoughts; and 'tis all one whether the Thoughts be excited mediately from ſomething without, or more immediately from ſomething within; whether the Tempter raiſe the Storm
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:100687:92"/>by a Witch, or his one immediate Empire over the Clouds, Vapours, Exhalations and Winds; whether he bring it in at the Cinque-ports of Senſe external, or impreſs it upon the internal working upon the Fancy and Invention, with the aid of Memory. For that by Gods Permiſſion he can move matter, is unqueſtionable, therefore congeſt our animal Spirits into ſuch Forms and Repreſentations by an immediate impulſe, as they are apt to receive from the Objects of outward Senſe, which he has the advantage of doing more effectually, upon inſpection of our natural Temper and Complexion, and therefore Incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, that cannot be concealed and hid from his inſinuating intellect, and critical Obſervation. Whence Melancholick Conſtitutions are moſt haun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with theſe black Spirits, and Temptations.</p>
               <p>Hither alſo is to be reduc'd <hi>Horror of Conſcience,</hi> either antecedent or ſubſequent to ſinful Practices or the Temptations to them; the former whereof is ſo commendable in all, the latter confounding. For if Conſcience ſtartle and be ſtruck with A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mazement and Aſtoniſhment, upon the temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to ſome horrid Crimes, (as it will ſometimes, even in the profligately Wicked, which is an evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence that they are not wholly given up by God) it may be ſtill capable of being touch'd with leſſer, with all, which may iſſue in true Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, through the Grace, Concurrence, and Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of Almighty God; or in further degrees of tenderneſs and reluctance to Sin, in thoſe that are already Converted, as a fruit of that gracious Promiſe of taking away the Heart of Stone, <hi>and giving an Heart of Fleſh,</hi> Ezek. 11.19. and 36.26. The <hi>Pſalmiſt</hi>'s here, was a dread of this Nature, and although this <hi>Pſalm</hi> give us no intimation of
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:100687:92"/>any horror in his mind at preſent, conſequent to evil Actions; yet part of the ſcope of the <hi>Pſalm</hi> is to excite it in others, whoſe Crimes he lays o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen, and aggravates as they deſerve. The Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience of his own Innocency now, did antidote ſuch troubles in himſelf, but his impleading his Enemies for the fouleſt Injuſtice and Babarouſneſs, has a tendency to rouze their ſleepy Conſciences, into ſuch an awakening ſenſe and feeling as might make them Terrors to themſelves; as himſelf was afterwards, upon his two foul Commiſſions, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 51.</p>
               <p>Neither are thoſe fears and dreads of <hi>Satan,</hi> and Spiritual Enemies, which ſometimes rack and cruciate the Minds of Men, altogether to be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten. He that is amazed at, and implores Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Mercy againſt the Temptation, cannot eaſily be reconciled to the Tempter, in whom, with his Angels there is a combination of every thing that can render Adverſaries formidable. What nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merous Legions in which not one ſingle Enemy, but is brim full of rancor and rage againſt us, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow'd with a world of crafty Politicks, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventive cunning, to deviſe whatever that unfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thomable depth of Malice and Emity, can direct againſt us, to ruin us everlaſtingly; together with an unknown and unimaginably great ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciency of Power and Activity to execute what they contrive, and they have no limits of their duration on this ſide Eternity. Oh dreadful Hoſt indeed, what may they deſpair to effect, upon impotent and degenerate ſinful Man.

Whence <hi>David, Pſal.</hi> 119.136. <hi>Rivers of Tears run down mine eyes, becauſe they keep not thy Law.</hi> Be their Sins only Omiſſions, which in the Eſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate of the World are of a lighter Nature, though not in the account of God, and an Illuminated Conſcience; yet will they be grievous to thoſe that love the Lord and his Laws: And 'tis a good token of Integrity when the Sins of others are a burden. Self may engage a Man againſt his own Sins, but if the wickedneſs of thoſe we have no concern with, deeply affect our Hearts, 'tis an Evidence we are acted by the Intereſt of God.</p>
               <p>Let this then, Oh my Soul, over-rule all thy Paſſions. Live under ſome ſenſe with God: What diſhonors him, let it humble thee. Be not ſo much troubled at the Miſchiefs, wherewith Men in the Triumphant Madneſs of their Proſperity, indeavour to plague thee, as at the Sin whereby they duel Heaven. Where thy Father ſuffers moſt in his Glory, do thou ſuffer with him. Thy Ira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcibles never act more commendably, than when they run upon the Errand of thy Maker. Thou art angry and ſinneſt not, when angry at Sin.
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:100687:97"/>'Tis hard not to Sin in Sorrow, if it be not Sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row for Sin. And if thou groan under the Wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſs of others, ſure thou wiltſt not, canſt not, darſt not be ſo much a Hypocrite, as to go light under the greater Load of thine own. Thou art conſcious to thy ſelf of many Circumſtances, ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gravating thine own, which thou haſt no reaſon to apply to the Crimes of any beſide. Where thou knoweſt of moſt Evil, and that is in thy ſelf, there muſt thou ſpend <hi>Oceans:</hi> ſince the little in compariſon, which thou knoweſt of other Mens faults, requires thy Rivers. Let thy Sorrows bear Proportion to thy Condition and Conſcience. Weep, or at leaſt mourn for, and bemoan others, but moſt thy ſelf. There muſt thou pay thy Drops, here a Deluge.</p>
               <p>To this place therefore appertains all Spiritual Trouble for Sin, and the want and weakneſs and defectiveneſs of Grace, with the effects thereof; That Anguiſh of Mind, which ſprings from the ſenſe of Sin's odiouſneſs of God: The Agonies and Anxieties of the <hi>New Birth,</hi> and under Relapſes, whatever goes under the name of a Wounded Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit or Troubled Conſcience. But,</p>
               <p n="2">2. Not only the evil of Sin, but other Evils, in themſelves or to him in effect, did ſadden the Holy Pſalmiſt's Soul. Two eſpecially,</p>

               <p n="2">2. The Unproſperous, Afflicted, Perſecuted State of the People of God, did excite in him ſorrowful Reflections.

And, How can the Body in many parts of it ſuffer, and the reſt have no Fellow-feeling? Thou art not vitally united as a Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber to the Body of Chriſt, Oh my Soul, but may'ſt
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:100687:98"/>juſtly dread that he will cut thee off, as a dead Libm, and bury thee in Hell, if thou be inſenſible of its Pains and Agonies. Shew that the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Soul and Spirit Animates thee, by a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon ſenſe with the reſt of the Members, that Communicate in it with thee. If thou be not with them in Paſſion, yet be in Compaſſion. <hi>Why Perſecuteſt thou me?</hi> Says Chriſt to <hi>Saul, Acts</hi> 9.4. The pain is in the Members, the ſenſe in the Head. Chriſt diſclaims thee, thou art none of that [me] whereof he is ſo tender, if thou ſuffer'ſt not by Commiſeration, when his Servants ſuffer Affliction. Put on thy Bowels, if thou deſireſt the Yernings of his, when thy Condition ſhall be like theirs. With the Prophet <hi>Jerem.</hi> 9.1. Say <hi>Oh that my Head were Waters, and mine Eyes a Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain of Tears, that I might weep Day and Night, for the ſlain of the Daughter of my People. My Bowels, my Bowels, I am pained at my very Heart, the Walls of my Heart make a noiſe in me, I cannot hold my Peace, becauſe thou haſt heard, Oh my Soul, the ſound of the Trumpet, the alarm of War.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To this Head may be reduced all thoſe Trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles, which are Fruits of Publick Calamities to Church or State, <hi>Perſecutions, Martyrdoms, Maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſacres,</hi> &amp;c.

               <p>Comfort is a Map of Paradiſe, the lovely Meet-Help and Succour of deſolate, diſtreſſed Man, the Bleſſed Repaſt and Banquet of Holy Angels and Saints: The Uncreated, Eternal Heaven and Jubilee of God himſelf; the Light wherein he e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver dwells, that ſpreads abroad its ſweet reviv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

And when the Sin of degenerate Man had baniſh'd it from the Earth, and his own Soul; the infinitely Wiſe and All-knowing God, the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, the dearly beloved Word and Wiſdom of God, his only Begotten Son, and the Eternal Spirit of Truth and Grace, did by an ever adore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able aſtoniſhing Method of Goodneſs and Love, contrive a Retrieval thereof, that under its loſs Man might not continue the moſt miſerable of the whole Creation. 'Tis the ſweet reviving Breath of boundleſs Grace, and compaſſion in the Eternal Father, infuſing new Life and Vigour into Fainting, Groaning, Bleeding, Dying Hearts, and Enſpiriting them for God. A refreſhing Beam from the Son of Righteouſneſs, which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſes Warmth, Strength and Soul, into the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſolate Heart of dejected Man, that lies benight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in a Hell of Miſery and Darkneſs: The Oyl of Life poured out by the Holy Ghoſt, upon a Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numbed, Frozen, Reſtive Soul, which gently turns the Wheels of Action in a ſmooth, free, ready, eaſie, ſpeedy Courſe, and continues them in an unwearied motion toward Heaven: A ſweet and lovely Paraphraſe upon the Promiſes, Ingra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven in a Wounded Heart by the Finger of God: A powerful Antidote to the Poiſon of Torment<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Grief and Deſpair, ſweeter than Sorrow can be ſowre: An all-ſatisfying Foretaſt and Antici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pation, of the never Intermitting, never Termi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nating Joys of Eternity.</p>

'Tis the refreſhing Dew of Heaven upon a barren heart, that has been ſcorched and parched with the fiery Indignation of the Almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, which cauſes it to bring forth Fruit with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joycing: The gracious Smile of the ever Bleſſed Jeſus, upon a weeping wounded Spirit, that's ſick of its ſins and ſores, ſick for the ſenſe of his <hi>Love:</hi> A hand let down from above, to lay hold upon, and bring up from the deep an oppreſſed Spirit, ſunk with the weight of its own woeful thoughts, into an unfathomable <hi>Abyſs</hi> of Miſeries: A re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning Pillar of Cloud and Fire, to an <hi>Iſraelite</hi> indeed, that was bewildred and loſt, in a vaſt howling Wilderneſs of Danger and Horror, to direct and lead it with Joy to its Coeleſtial Reſt: A ſecure and welcome Port of ſafety and repoſe, for a weather-beaten Soul, that by the ſtorms and ſurges of Almighty Vengeance, hath been Shipwrack'd and ſplit all to pieces, in a Contrition and Humiliation for Sin: A Bed of eaſe and qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>et for a weak and ſickly weary heart, which hath been wreſtling and labouring under the weighty

               <p>I am not concern'd, except about the <hi>Matter, Means,</hi> revealing, containing, and the <hi>Believing Thoughts,</hi> that receive and apply; with the <hi>Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,</hi> that prepares the Heart for Reception and Application of <hi>Comfort.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Whatever Comforts, is ſomething of, or from God, <hi>The Father, Son, and Holy Ghoſt;</hi> yet thoſe things from them, <hi>Comfort</hi> not in the ſame man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, as <hi>they</hi> do themſelves. The Word and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes are a <hi>Cordial,</hi> as far as Meſſages of <hi>Love</hi> from Heaven, no otherwiſe: As they bring good News from our beſt Friend, they revive us; but nothing can give eaſe to our Minds, which doth not report ſomething of God. If our Troubles be <hi>Spiritual</hi> for our Sins, the aſſurance by any ſound Evidence, that God has pardoned them, diſpels our <hi>Sorrow, Fear, and Deſpair:</hi> The feeling that God has purged away their Filth, taken away their Dominion, quiets us, as an Evidence and Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony, that he hath pardoned us, and is reconci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led to us; but all this only as a token of <hi>God's Love</hi> to us. For a good Soul cannot ſit down with its own Mercy, without the God of Mercy. Nothing Spiritually Comforts on Earth, but what will ſolace in Heaven. There God alone is the Eternal Raviſhment of glorified Souls. Now God, as the matter of our Comfort, ſolaces us merely as apprehended, and applied by <hi>Believing Thoughts.</hi> If we think not of him, we derive no Content from him; and our Thoughts taking in ſome com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable Notion of God, lay it before our Concu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſcible and Iraſcible Affections, that being em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braced
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:100687:102"/>by the former, it may appeaſe, ſtill, and quiet the other; which is heedfully to be obſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, this being the true and natural Method to attain ſolid, and ſubſtantial Peace, and Conſola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: For they are Brutiſh, not Rational Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts, that we are not led to by Light in the Mind, obſerving the ſuitableneſs of the Object to our Condition, which prevails with our Will, to cloſe with, and embrace it. Till this be done, our Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions cannot be rationally calmed. God doth not work upon them, as <hi>Chriſt</hi> upon the raging Sea, by way of Empire, and immediate Power, to huſh them in a moment by Miracle.

               <p>There's nothing that can any ways Comfort, but God is that very thing, either <hi>Formally</hi> or <hi>Eminently:</hi> He is the ſumm and ſubſtance of all Appetibles, Eligibles, Comfortables, as the <hi>Chief Good</hi> and Happineſs of Man; who, as he wants nothing for his own everlaſting ſolace and conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, ſo neither for ours: Whatever is of a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſhing Influence, either to Body or Mind, is the Ordination of God, both in its Matter, and that peculiar Formality: For he both made all things, and endowed them with all their Powers and Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues, which all are ſuperlatively in himſelf; <hi>i. e.</hi> either in his Nature or Power, in Eſſence or Equivalence. God's Love is a Comfort to our Souls, and God is Love. Meat and Drink are a comfort to our Bodies; God is not theſe, but he can create and give them, and in Heaven ſupplies the want of them, by cauſing us not to need them, and giving us better in himſelf, that Countervails

For nothing iſſuing from God, is greater or better than himſelf, He <hi>is</hi> much more than all without him, therefore a more ſufficient ſatisfaction; both becauſe there is a plenitude of Perfection in him, and becauſe he can inlarge the capacity of the Recipient, and quicken the perceptive Powers, more exquiſitely to ſenſe, and reliſh the Sweetneſs of all thoſe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lectable Excellencies that adorn his Nature.

               <p>
                  <hi>El ſhaddai</hi>] (an additional, not indeed ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs in the Pſalm, but neceſſary to be mentioned in order to the explaining of the following <hi>Jehovah,</hi> ſo often uſed here) God All-ſufficient, or Almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. In him therefore is there abundantly enough to ſatisfie intenſively all Appetites, in all their extents and poſſibilities. This Name he gives himſelf, with reſpect to his making Promiſes, wherein mercies are exhibited as future; whence it ſecures to us fully his ſingular Good Will, and engages our Faith and Hope, and improves, and heightens them into an Aſſurance, that Bleſſings and Comforts, now out of our hands, ſhall in due Seaſon (which himſelf is fitteſt to chuſe) be put into our poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion by him: Under his Name</p>
               <p>JEHOVAH], mention'd <hi>Ver.</hi> 1.3, 5, 11, 14, 17, 18, 22, 23. the proper and immediate reaſon of his giving himſelf this Name, being his preſent purpoſe to fulfil with his Hand, what he had ſpoke with his Mouth long before, and give actual Being by his Power and Providence to that, which only
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:100687:104"/>had a poſſible Vertual Being, in his Promiſe made under the Name of <hi>Elſhaddai.</hi> This then is a Name, intimating, that He is not a Promiſer afar off, but a Performer at hand, ready to comfort us in, and ſave us out of our Spiritual Thraldom, under Corruption, Temptation, and Affliction of Body and Mind. And being</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Adonai,</hi> (which the Jews alway read inſtead of the <hi>Tetragrammaton</hi> (as the Name <hi>Jehovah</hi> is called) except where they are together) <hi>Lord</hi> and <hi>Soveraign</hi> over All; he hath a Right and Power to diſpoſe of all Perſons, and Things, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the good pleaſure of his own Will, and cannot be controul'd in his Purpoſes, or Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formances, by any, but at their Peril.

               </p>
               <p>§. 1. <hi>His Wiſdom and Omniſcience,</hi> Ver. 9.10, 11. 'Twas a Queſtion only becoming the Frenzy and Folly of a degenerate wicked Heart. <hi>How doth God know? And is there Knowledge in the moſt High? Pſal.</hi> 73.11. Yes that there is, as you ſhall know to your ſorrow; but the Godly do experience it to their wonderful Satisfaction. <hi>All the Evils we feel, He knows very well,</hi> though we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not; nay, though we will not, though we dare not repreſent or deſcribe them; and a Friend's Knowledge of its Troubles, is ſome eaſe to an oppreſſed Heart. But our Griefs are not only the Objects of his Underſtanding, but the Diſpoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of his Wiſdom, which being infinitely more comprehenſive than ours, did deſign, and knows how to effect our greateſt Good out of that, which our ſhallow Capacities apprehend to be the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Evil. 'Tis no little <hi>Solace,</hi> that boundleſs <hi>Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,</hi> which can never project Evil, doth perfectly ſee and know this to be beſt for us, which it diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pences to us: And though now we cannot fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thom the <hi>Myſteries</hi> of this manifold <hi>Wiſdom,</hi> Eph. 3.10. (as how ſhould Finite comprehend Infinite?) Yet the Reaſons of its Proceedure, will be unfold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed hereafter, to the general Satisfaction of the whole World. Have we not then ſufficient ground to acquieſce, and be pleas'd with that now, (altho' we cannot dive into its Methods) which with the higheſt complacency we ſhall acquieſce and rejoyce in for ever, when we more truly underſtand it?</p>
               <p>Beſide, Infinite Wiſdom is ſtored with Means, Devices, and Ways, to comfort us, beyond all we are able to conceive. The incomparable Riches of Divine Conſolation, are owing to the inexhau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtible
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:100687:105"/>Treaſures of that Wiſdom, which can find out ſuch as are moſt ſuitable, and moſt ſeaſonably and effectually apply them: And foreſeeing what may be a Bar to them, can tell how to uſe the moſt proper Methods to remove it, this being its moſt genuine work, to know, chuſe and uſe, the moſt accommodate and efficacious Means, to bring about the moſt excellent End. We triumph in the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyment of ſuch Relief in a Friend on Earth; Have we not abundantly more reaſon, to ſolace our ſelves in the friendly aſpect and ſuperinten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of ſuch an infinite Perfection in Heaven? <hi>Is Satan</hi> continually injecting Terrors or Trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles, or exciting diſguſtful horrid Imaginations? Does he appear in the guiſe of the Fool, and ſay, <hi>in</hi> thy <hi>heart there is no God,</hi> &amp;c.? <hi>Pſal.</hi> 14.1. Does he with <hi>Job</hi>'s Wife put on the deſperate Bedlam, and bid thee <hi>Curſe God,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>and dye? Job</hi> 2.9. Does he perſonate the Cheating Knave, and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſe thee to defraud either <hi>God</hi> of his due Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip and Honour, or Man of his due Reſpect and Right? Does he transform himſelf into an An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel of Light, and engage thee to be wiſe and <hi>Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous overmuch? Eccleſ.</hi> 7.16. Or laſtly, Does he come in his own Form, to invite thee to Lying, <hi>Pride, Malice, Revenge, Slaunder, Backbiting,</hi> &amp;c. his proper Sins, in which, with a daring Impudence, he would out-brave and out-face even his <hi>Maker,</hi> in his <hi>Accuſations of the Brethren,</hi> &amp;c.? Whatever his <hi>Methods,</hi> Eph. 6.11. or <hi>Wiles, Deviſes,</hi> 2 Cor. 2.11. <hi>Snares,</hi> 1. Tim. 3.7. 2 Tim. 2.26. <hi>Depths, Rev.</hi> 2.24. Whatever his <hi>Stratagems, Policies,</hi> are, to delude, defile, diſquiet, or deſtroy thee, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever cunningly, craftily managed: Yet ſtill is he not too wiſe for God, who well knows how to defeat all his Deſignments, and amongſt infinite
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:100687:105"/>other, has this one Method to lead thee to Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, (even when thine Adverſary hath out-witted and got the better of thee, and is leading thee in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Temptation, Trouble, and Torment,) <hi>viz.</hi> to bring thee thorow the narrow way of <hi>Repentance,</hi> to a <hi>New Life of Grace, Peace, Joy, and Conſolation,</hi> preſent and eternal. This he doth oftentimes with Man, <hi>Job</hi> 33.28, 29. Read from the 14th. to the 31ſt. <hi>Job</hi> 28, 28. <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nto Man he ſaid, behold the fear of the Lord,</hi> (true Religiouſneſs) <hi>that is Wiſdom, and to depart from evil,</hi> (true Repentance) <hi>that is <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderſtanding.</hi> He knows how to rule the raging of that Sea of Sorrow, Terror, and An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh, wherewith the <hi>Devil</hi> attempts to overwhelm thee, and ſhipwrack all thy Hopes, and Happineſs; and ſo turns the Storm into a Calm of Godly ſorrow, that Satans Creature yields, and gives place to the Creation of God, and the Grief which God exhales, does iſſue in the fruit of the Lips, <hi>Peace,</hi> of the ſame extracti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Iſ.</hi> 57.19.</note> and thus is Satan over-reach'd and baffled in his moſt ſubtle Contrivances, and his Machinations to ruine our Comfort, become means for its Eſtabliſhment.</p>
               <p>But if his own immediate Actings be ſecond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the Agency of his Inſtruments, that all the Politicks on Earth combine with thoſe of <hi>Hell,</hi> to overturn our ſecurity and reſt: Yet are they never the nearer their Purpoſe, of ſubverting the Counſels of <hi>Heaven,</hi> for the ſolace of our troubled Hearts; but rather promote them, whilſt they drive us nearer God, as our everlaſting Refuge, and Sanctuary, in whom we may be ſure to find a Fulneſs of Joy and Compenſation. Is all the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Wiſdom on Earth ſet on the rack, to deviſe the Ruine of True Religion, and Thee in the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion and Practice of it? Are wicked Men thy
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:100687:106"/>particular Foes, in a Confederacy againſt thee, contriving thy Deſtruction in Spirituals and Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porals? Yet where-ever they <hi>deal wiſely, proudly,</hi> cruelly, He is <hi>above them?</hi> Art thou thy ſelf, are all Men elſe at a loſs in their Thoughts, either, how Religion ſhould be ſecured, in whole, or in part, when at any time its Enemies conſpire a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt it; or <hi>how</hi> Jacob <hi>ſhould ariſe when he is very ſmall;</hi> or how thy Perſonal Intereſt ſhould be ſafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guarded, or how thy Health reſtored, or Death prevented, or Deliverance be wrought under ſome grievous Calamity, or any Mercy obtain'd for Soul or Body, thy ſelf, thy Friends, or the <hi>Church</hi> and <hi>Nation?</hi> Be not ſolicitous, the All-comprehend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Wiſdom of <hi>Heaven</hi> can never be at a Loſs, this unſearchable underſtanding has all Poſſibilities preſent in view, and cannot but chuſe the beſt for Himſelf, for Thee, for All; and it ſeldom begins of its Work, till all be at their Wits end; when every thing elſe fails, and the Wiſdom of Men has given up all for gone, <hi>Divine Wiſdom</hi> reſumes the Work, and glorifies its ſelf, in bringing it to Perfection. In ſhort, all the Artifices of Earth and Hell, cannot invent or reduce into Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, ſo deplorable and deſperate, as to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>match the Contrivance of Infinite Wiſdom for our Comfort, under and after them; its Proviſions are truly Catholick, extending to all poſſible Caſes, Conditions, Seaſons, Places, and Perſons; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of the Holy Scriptures are a full Evidence, as a legible Declaration of the Unfathomable <hi>Wiſdom of God. Here are the Rivers, whoſe Streams make glad the City of God,</hi> Pſal. 46.4. Oh the Adore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Plenitude of the written <hi>Word of God,</hi> which comprehends the whole Counſel of God for our Illumination, Effectual Calling, Sanctification, Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtification,
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:100687:106"/>Comfort, and Eternal Salvation! There is nothing deviſed by the Infinite Underſtanding of God, for the Eaſe and Quiet of troubled Hearts, but which is contained in the Bible, a Tranſcript whereof upon the Heart, creates a Life of Joy, Peace, and Reſt. <hi>God's Wiſdom</hi> ſpeaks Peace to us, in no other Language than that of the Word. 'Tis indeed viſible in his Works of Creation, and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence, which are under its Conduct, and bear its lively Characters, but theſe ſcarce intelligible, without the Sacred Writings. Here only is all perſpicuous and plain, that's needful, either to pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifie, or pacify the Conſcience. What a World of Conſolatory Matter is couched in this one Pſalm, will appear anon: What then is there in the whole Book of God? Judge of the Immenſe Ocean, by this Little Rivulet. Admire and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence that incomparable Abſtract of the Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of Heaven, in theſe Lively Oracles, and hence derive all thy Conſolations.</p>
               <p>§. 2. This Wiſdom is not alone, nor in this Caſe, a Self-mover, but goes upon the Errand and Deſigns of Infinite Gooodneſs: An Attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute brim-full of Solace, Joy and Reſt; as our Pſalmiſt found, <hi>Ver.</hi> 18. eſpecially, and every where, <hi>Ver.</hi> 12, 13, 14, 15, 17.19, 21. Indeed, every Requeſt in the Pſalm ſuppoſes it, and eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Aſſertion refers to it, even his Complaints are Addreſſes to it, and all his Expectations are from it; 'tis the good Blood that runs in every Vein, not a Verſe but points at it. Now, as Wiſdom chuſes the Method and Means of applying Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, and pitches upon ſuch as are moſt accommo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>date in particular: So Goodneſs adminiſters the Matter in general. Every thing that creates the light of Gladneſs and Conſolation, in a dark be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nighted,
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:100687:107"/>troubled ſoul, is a ſpark, a beam of <hi>Goodneſs.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Goodneſs of God lies in Two Things, <hi>Love</hi> and <hi>Holineſs.</hi> Did I call them Two? They are both but only <hi>Love. Love</hi> in us, is <hi>Holineſs,</hi> as a Conformity to the whole Law of God: <hi>Holineſs</hi> in God, is nothing but <hi>Love</hi> to himſelf, as the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone perfect Law and Standard of all Incompre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſible Excellency and Glory. But to conſider them as diſtinct.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Love</hi> is that illuſtrious greateſt Light amongſt the Divine Perfections, the benign Rays where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, are plenteouſly reflected through the Sun of Righteouſneſs, upon wretched and miſerable Man. <hi>God is Love,</hi> 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 4.16. <hi>and Love in its Perfection is God;</hi> that <hi>Love,</hi> which <hi>God</hi> is, is <hi>God,</hi> and dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſes its ſweet Influences upon us, in wonderful variety. Not that it is other than Unity indivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible, invariable in it ſelf; but that it meets with ſeveral reſpects, and produces divers effects in us. We are Sinners, the guilt it pardons, the filth it purges, the power of Sin it ſubdues. We are miſerable through ſin; <hi>Love</hi> lays it to heart, that's <hi>Mercy:</hi> Is afflicted in our Afflictions, there's <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion;</hi> has yerning Bowels towards us, which is <hi>Pity;</hi> bears much at our hands, and this is <hi>Pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence;</hi> ſuſpends the Puniſhment due to our ſin, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther for an Indefinite time, therefore called <hi>For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bearance;</hi> or a great while, whence 'tis ſtiled <hi>Long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuffering;</hi> or exempts us wholly, under the Name of <hi>Sparing-Mercy;</hi> or deals moderately with us, in <hi>Gentleneſs</hi> and <hi>Tenderneſs:</hi> We want many good things, eſpecially Himſelf: <hi>Benevolence</hi> will our Good; <hi>Bounty</hi> and <hi>Kindneſs</hi> impart All to Us; <hi>Graciouſneſs</hi> does All freely: Oh Aſtoniſhing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Rich and Glorious Well-ſpring of Everlaſting Conſolation! There's no Exigence befals Man,
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:100687:107"/>either thro' emptineſs, or miſery, that is deſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute of a Perfection in Infinite <hi>Love,</hi> to make a peculiar and accommodate Relief and Supply. Divine <hi>Goodneſs</hi> bears ſuch a ſingular reſpect to our indigent Nature, that notwithſtanding its in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dividual <hi>Singleneſs</hi> and <hi>Oneneſs,</hi> it does as it were parcel out it ſelf, into a multiplicity of ſweet refreſhing Cordials, in Condeſcenſion to our Infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity, that in it we may have a particular Satisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, for every diſtinct Appetite, a proper Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy for every ſingle Malady. There's no Caſe, in which we can need, or deſire Comfort, but there is a Revelation of ſome comfortable Perfection in God, which ſpeaks directly to it, and adminiſters a ſuccour and ſupport to us, no leſs than Infinite; that is, incomprehenſibly more extenſive, and Inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive, than our Circumſtances can be neceſſitous, or dolorous. Indeed, nothing comforts but <hi>Love;</hi> no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more diſquiets, than ſenſe of Enmity, Hatred, Anger, Diſpleaſure. The more we are concern'd in any, the more pleaſing is Reſpect from them, and an unloving Deportment more grievous. We are not much affected with the love of Strangers, but rejoyce in the Good-will of our Neighbours, our Friends, our Relations, expecting it ſhould bear proportion to our Intereſt in them, and theirs in us, elſe it pleaſes not. We muſt have more Love from thoſe in our Vicinity, than from Aliens, from intimate Acquaintance, than either; from our Fleſh and Blood, than all, or it troubles us. But the due meaſure (nay if it be an exceſs) of af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection is moſt taking, we are moſt at eaſe un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der it. Again, as the Relation, ſo the Quality of Perſons muſt vary the degree of Love, or we are not at reſt. The regard of a mean Man does not ſo much delight us, as of the Great; that of
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:100687:108"/>Bad Men is not ſo ſweet as that of the Good. Further, thoſe we expect moſt good from, moſt refreſh us with their Love; where we lay out no hopes, from thoſe, (ſuch is the Selfiſhneſs of our Nature) we are not ſolicitous to gain any Love. So we are moſt earneſtly deſirous of the Affections of thoſe, whoſe Anger can, and is likely, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged to do us the greateſt Hurt: whom we there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore have reaſon moſt to fear; if we can win their hearts, 'tis a wonderful Contentation. Now God, the neareſt, greateſt, moſt potent <hi>Neighbour, Friend</hi> or <hi>Enemy,</hi> is not only <hi>Loving,</hi> but <hi>Love</hi> its ſelf, in the abſtract; not limited in kind or degree, but unmeaſurable, infinite <hi>Love;</hi> ſuch on the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, is his Wrath alſo. Of all other, his <hi>Love</hi> is moſt capable (and engaged too) to do us the greateſt Good, if we be capable of it: His Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred and Anger, like to do us the greateſt harm, if we do not betake our ſelves, to the refuge and ſecurity of his Love. But he who is eſſential un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>confincable <hi>Graciouſneſs,</hi> does with a natural Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection regard us, as the Work of his hands in <hi>Creation,</hi> with a Paternal, Conjugal Reſpect, em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace us as his Workmanſhip, created in Chriſt Jeſus to good Works; if forſaking all other, we cleave unto him with full purpoſe of heart, in a ſincere Child-like, Spouſe-like Affection, being a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain begotten by his Word and Spirit to a lively Hope, and ſo in Marriage-Covenant with him. This then is a Comfort, as large as its Subject; Divine Love, a ſatisfaction as boundleſs as the <hi>Deity;</hi> for it infinitely pleaſes even God himſelf: Infinite though he be, therefore is ſufficient ſure to adminiſter a Content to us, ſweet and great be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond all Expreſſion, all Cogitation. The Holy Men of God, which the Scripture propounds for
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:100687:108"/>our Examples, alway took Sanctuary here, in the aſſaults of their moſt grievous Troubles and Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptations. <hi>Jer.</hi> 31.12. <hi>They ſhall ſlow together to the goodneſs of the Lord,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>And their Soul ſhall be as a watered Garden, and they ſhall not ſorrow any more at all.</hi> 13. <hi>I will turn their mourning into joy, and will comfort them, and make them rejoyce from their ſorrow.</hi> 14. <hi>And I will ſatiate the ſoul of the Prieſts with fatneſs, and my People ſhall be ſatisfied with my Goodneſs, ſaith the Lord.</hi> Pſal. 119.76. <hi>Let I pray thee thy merciful kindneſs be for my Comfort,</hi> &amp;c. And indeed, let the ſtorms rage, and the ſea roar, and beat as high as it can, there will for ever be ſure Anchor-hold, for a good Soul, upon the Rock of Ages: Fix there, and thou canſt never ſhipwrack; nay, if thou canſt but weakly and waveringly, with a trembling heart and hand, hold this <hi>Love,</hi> be not diſcouraged; for with a ſtrong unconque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable hand, it holds thee, <hi>Joh.</hi> 10.28, 29. All other Divine Perfections miniſter to his <hi>Love,</hi> which has already beſtowed the greateſt Gifts: Himſelf, as an overflowing <hi>Jordan</hi> of enriching Goodneſs; His Only-begotten <hi>Son, Joh.</hi> 3.16. The choiceſt Bleſſing, and the ſureſt Pledge of all other, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.32. Nay, thy ſelf to thy ſelf freed from the bondage of Sin and <hi>Satan.</hi> Though I be in no deſireable Circumſtances, as to other things, yet if I be mine own Man, and enjoy a juſt Liberty of Body and Mind, in no ſlavery of Spirit and Condition; I can ſing over my other Misfortunes, eſpecially when I can read my own Felicity in the Miſery of others, through a Thral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, which I eſcape. Indeed, my Commiſera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions impreſs ſome part of their Calamity upon my Soul, but 'tis countervail'd and over-top'd by the Comfort of mine own Indemnity. But
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:100687:109"/>there can be no liberty under the Dominion of Sin, nor any true Self-enjoyment, till I enjoy <hi>God,</hi> and my ſelf in him, in whom I have my beſt and ſweeteſt <hi>Being, Motion,</hi> and <hi>Life.</hi> And though I enjoy my Civil and Moral Freedom, which is no little Comfort, yet Vaſſalage to the Prince of <hi>Darkneſs,</hi> is an Affliction more grievous, than the other can be ſolacing. When a <hi>Good Man is ſatisfied from</hi> [of, with] <hi>himſelf,</hi> Prov. 14.14. 'tis only as far as the Goodneſs of God dwells in him, and he in it. For if I poſſeſs not God, I have nothing with a Bleſſing, therefore not with Comfort. I have no Right to comforta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Thoughts, contenting Enjoyments, no not to my ſelf, and in my ſelf. For what am I that is good, what am I not that is evil, without God; and what ſatisfaction can I receive in that which is evil, as I my ſelf, and every thing in me will unavoidably be, if not antidoted and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimated by the Goodneſs of God? Men are not more miſerable, in a Deprival of all the Content of their Lives, than in the Dereliction of God. God gave me my ſelf as a Loan of Love; what I am I owe to Him; but by my ſin, I have loſt both my ſelf and Him: If now by a new Charter, He reſtore to me a better Right to Himſelf, and to my ſelf, in His Son <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> whoſe I am by Right of <hi>Redemption,</hi> and not mine own; if He re-inveſt me in a Liberty to enjoy my ſelf in Him, which I could not do under ſo bad a Maſter, ſo cruel a Tyrant as the Devil; this is a piece of the choiceſt Happineſs which I can enjoy on this ſide Heaven. Liberty to ſin, is the moſt uncomfortable Bondage. Neceſſity to ſerve God, the moſt ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lacing Liberty. The moſt of this do we enjoy, when we live moſt in, and are ſwallowed up of
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:100687:109"/>the Love of God. Corruption is a Dungeon, a Priſon, a Pit; <hi>God loves</hi> us out of it; <hi>Iſa.</hi> 38.17. <hi>into the glorious Liberty of the Sons of God,</hi> Rom. 8.21. <hi>Love</hi> is the Wealth of <hi>Heaven</hi> and the <hi>World,</hi> a Treaſure invaluable, in Compariſon whereof, every thing, all the Riches, Honours, Pleaſures; all the Subſtance and Glory of the World, is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptible, <hi>Cant.</hi> 8.7. Every Comfort is compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended in it, 'tis the Life and Soul of all; they are but Carrion-Contents, that are poſſeſt without it. Oh Incomparable, incomprehenſible <hi>Love!</hi> How haſt thou even out-done thy ſelf in thy Proviſions for the Conſolation of inconſiderable Man? What infinite Deſires could ever have wiſh'd, what in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite Goodneſs could ever have beſtowed a Gift greater than Infinite? <hi>God's Love</hi> gives no leſs, and ſure it can no greaten.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Love</hi> is all Comfort, and <hi>Holineſs</hi> in God, is not a Barren Womb, but Pregnant alſo with the ſweeteſt Conſolations.

And 'tis true, <hi>Righteouſneſs</hi> is of a
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:100687:110"/>ſtable,<note place="margin">Sunt certi denique fines, quos ultrà citra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>que nequit conſiſtere rectum.</note> firm, invariable nature: Judgment or Proceedures in Law, are changeable, ſometimes wrong, ſometimes right; now on this ſide, then on the other, depending upon the mutable Conſtitution of the <hi>Judges.</hi> Whence 'tis, that Judgment is here repreſented as a Travel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler from home, but upon the Return, in which motion it ſhould never reſt, till it (which had been ſo long abſent) got to the abode of <hi>Righteouſneſs</hi> again. Unrighteous Judgment did then prevail, but begun to be weary of it ſelf, and at length muſt down, and <hi>Righteous Judgment</hi> be ſet up and eſtabliſhed; which, when once accompliſhed, the upright in heart, would certainly be advanced. Let but true Juſtice obtain, and immediately after that, Upright Men will return out of the Retirements, into which Unrighteouſneſs had driven them, and be in repute again. <hi>Goodneſs</hi> cannot be ſuppreſt by <hi>Juſtice,</hi> but only by Injury; and when it is turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed out of doors, cannot be introduced, except by the Soveraign Goodneſs of God, to which its Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution is here aſcribed, <hi>Ver.</hi> 14. as a Fruit of his Abode with, and conſtant Adherence to his Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. The whole Proceſs then of the Prophet's Reaſoning, is this; <hi>Although God's People be now op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs'd, and ruin'd by the violent Perverſion of Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: Yet God will not alway permit it to be ſo, but will eſtabliſh Righteous Judgment firſt, and then relieve his People by it.</hi> Divine Purity then, will not long permit the Dominion of Unrighteouſneſs. God's <hi>Holineſs</hi> will e're long haraſs all Unholineſs out of the World, and confine it forever unto Hell. There ſhall be none in thy ſight abroad, there ſhall be none in thy heart within. That which is thy greateſt Diſcomfort on Earth, which muddies thy Thoughts,
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:100687:110"/>diſquiets thy mind, racks and tortures thy Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, diſcompoſes thy Affections, blaſts thy Hopes, ſowres thy Joys, burthens thy whole Soul, makes Heaven and Earth groan, and ſigh in Pain; ſhall finally give place to the <hi>Divine Nature,</hi> which the Promiſes bring thee in part, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.4. and Heaven will perfect. Oh bleſſed ſolacing Hope, a ſecure Anchor in the deepeſt Sea of Sorrows! Art thou at preſent in Affliction for thy un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holineſs: Know that this very trouble is a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſation of boundleſs Love and Sanctity, directed by unfathomable Wiſdom, and of moſt illuſtrious Wiſdom, acted by unconceivable Love and Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, for thy higheſt advantage; to embitter thy Corruptions, ſeparate them from thy Soul, and prepare thee for the embraces of the tendereſt Affections of Heaven, and its everlaſting Joys and Reſt. Neither can there any other Tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or Affliction befall thee, without God's leave, and his Goodneſs can no more be excluded out of his deſignments than his knowledge; even his Permiſſions are ſubſervient to the purpoſes of his Love, nor can any thing betide us, which will yeild an Argument to prove that he is not Good, any more than that he is not God. Whatever Perplexities ſink thy Heart, if they have a tenden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy to defile thee, they are Enemies to Divine Puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and it will overcome them, cannot be van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſh'd by them; if they tend to diſquiet thee, the unboundable Love that embraces thee, will not, cannot leave thee to ſuccumb, and finally to deſpond under them; if Spiritual, this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitely gracious Spirit, is an Adverſary to them, and will maſter them; if Temporal, there is a Remedy againſt them in the Goodneſs of God which is Eternal.</p>

<pb n="204" facs="tcp:100687:114"/>is given me, of ſo great an advantage, ſo happy an iſſue as will compenſate the trouble; if all a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long I find by experience that 'tis for the beſt, and if I had been to carve for my ſelf, and ſpin the thread of my own Fortune, I could not have pitch'd upon any thing ſo eligible as what is diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens'd to me without my choice, by the Wiſdom and provident Goodneſs of Heaven; every of theſe things ſingly yields me a plentiful harveſt of quiet in my Mind, and contentedneſs with my Condition; much more joyntly altogether. And has not every good Soul the ampleſt ſecurity, that it ſhall be bleſt with all this, and much more, in and through the benignity and Love of God? Have we not ground to believe that Love will not permit any evil to interrupt our Joys, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept there be need? <hi>That Love will cut it ſhort in Righteouſneſs, it ſhall be but for a moment, a little mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment? Love being afflicted in all our Afflictions,</hi> will not long torment it ſelf. What Love promiſes, Power can command. In that very ſmall moment of continuance, I am ſecure, that Love will not ſuffer my Miſeries and Diſquiets, to commit a rape upon my beſt ſatisfactions in it ſelf: and that I ſhall loſe no Metal, but only Droſs, which 'tis my happineſs to do, and even that loſs (if my gain of Refinement and Purity deſerve that Name) will be recompenced to the full, in thoſe infinitely better things laid up in ſtore for me, in the plenitude and all-ſufficiency of unboundable Goodneſs in the Divine Nature and Perſons. But be the Calamity as great and malignant: as is ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginable, I have <hi>a Rock higher than I,</hi> where I may be ſafe, above the reach of ruin. For having paſt the pangs of the New Birth, the worſt is paſt, both in reſpect of Pain and Danger, Sorrow and

Though my Veſſel, the Body, may be bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken; yet ſhall I certainly land in ſafety upon the bleſſed ſhore of Eternity, with all my real Riches and Comforts environing me. I am I hope in a ſound bottom indeed; Chriſt carries me in his Body, his Bowels; that's the Ship wherein I am wafted over the Tempeſtuous Ocean of Miſeries in this World, to the fair Havens of everlaſting Loves, Joys, and Reſt. The foreknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge whereof, together with my preſent ſenſe of profit in my Soul, ſtrength againſt Sin, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution for God, evidence and experience of his Preſence, Support, Influence, Grace, the affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onate workings of his Heart in Love, Care, Kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, flowing over all the banks in multitudes of unmerited Bleſſings in Temporals, but eſpecially in Celeſtials: Theſe ſweeten all my Sorrows and eaſe my burthened Spirit, that I cannot but ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge the Proviſions of Infinite Wiſdom, incomprehenſibly more eligible and beneficial than the utmoſt that could ever enter into my ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt raiſed Imaginations.</p>

                  <note place="margin">Remuner a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Juſtice is in reality goodneſs.</note> to a believing Soul, through Jeſus Chriſt; notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding that it is the moſt terrible, to the impenitent Chriſtleſs. A Paradox eaſily made out, thus: That which makes our Mercy and Comfort ſure, and neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, that we cannot miſs of enjoying it, is more comfortable, than that which leaves it at liberty, and only renders it poſſible. When a good thing is in the free diſpoſe of a <hi>Donor,</hi> that he may chuſe whether he will beſtow it or no, we can have no certainty at all that we ſhall receive it; no not when we have infallible aſſurance of his Inclinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to beſtow it: For 'tis ſtill in his own Power, and he may ſuſpend the Gift as he pleaſes, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any impeach to his Honour. And though it may to us ſeem Congruous to his goodneſs to grant it, yet is he not neceſſarily ty'd to our Laws of Congruity, neither can they impoſe upon his Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, and make his Mercy fatality. God Almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty bears a ſingular good Will to all his Creatures, eſpecially the reaſonable, would not that any pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh, 'tis no pleaſure to him; but that all Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind <hi>ſhould come to the knowledge of the Truth, and</hi> (through Repentance and Faith in Chriſt) <hi>be ſaved.</hi> This Repentance and Faith are his Gift, which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main in the free diſpoſal of his own good pleaſure, to confer upon whom he pleaſes: therefore the Gift of Repentance ſtands upon a <hi>Peradventure,</hi> 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.25. without any injury to <hi>Divine Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,</hi> which is not at all the leſs, though this Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing be denied to the greateſt part of the World, and to all the fallen Angels: For more Goodneſs and a ſtrong Inclination to Communicate, tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers no right, therefore no wrong is done by the ſuſpence or denial of the Gratuity expected. But
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:100687:116"/>then Juſtice ſuppoſes a right, and dueneſs of the Bleſſing, and that it cannot be in Righteouſneſs withholden, therefore makes it undoubtedly ſure from him, that cannot poſſibly be unjuſt. Now, though nothing be, or can be due from Juſtice to a Sinner, conſidered as ſuch, but only Indignati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and Wrath, on account of the Covenant of Works; yet the Covenant of Grace transfers a right to Mercy, upon thoſe that fulfil its Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions: Therefore the gift of Pardon to the Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant, is no leſs an Act of Juſtice, than free Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and Grace; and there the Scripture lays it, with Sanctification alſo. 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 1.9. <hi>If we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs our Sins, he is faithful and juſt to forgive us our Sins, and to cleanſe us from all <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nrighteouſneſs.</hi> Mark firſt <hi>[Faithful]</hi> which reſpects the Promiſe and Covenant, granting aright out of meer good Will and Grace, and then, and not till then, <hi>[Juſt,]</hi> diſtributing what the Covenant and Promiſe had made due, and an Irrevocable Right. Oh rich Comfort! <hi>Pardon and Purification,</hi> and both from Juſtice! What can we expect more to ſatisfie our utmoſt Cravings? Since theſe are Vertually all Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual and Coeleſtial Mercies, giving a right to <hi>Peace and Glory.</hi> Oh everlaſting inexhauſtible, mine of the ſweeteſt Joy and Reſt! What is the ſource of all thy Sorrows? Nothing but ſin: This grinds thy Conſcience in pain; this brings all the exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Grievances of thy Life. By Nature thou art as bad as Sin and Hell can make thee, though not in the degree, yet in the kind of badneſs, <hi>viz.</hi> Moral Conſcience of forepaſt Wickedneſs, is a Cut-throat to all Comfort. Mens eyes when o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened indeed, are more apt to look backward than forward. Upon Reflection, paſt Evils of Sin ſting more ſmartingly, than the Remembrance of
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:100687:117"/>paſt Evils of Suffering can refreſh and ſolace. 'Tis not ſo Comfortable to think that the worſt is paſt in Affliction, as grievous to conſider paſt Evils of Sin, for which the worſt is to come. The plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure in acting is infinitely ſhort of the pain in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penting; eſpecially in Hell. A Man would for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feit all the Joys of his Life, upon Condition he had never defiled his Conſcience: as the Devil in the poſſeſſed Woman told the Biſhop of <hi>Cambray,</hi> that he could be willing to ſuffer all imaginable Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to the Worlds end, ſo he might but then return into Heaven. Nothing more bitter in the Belly, than the Sins that were moſt ſweet in the Mouth: The Digeſtion troubles the Bowels infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely more, than the Maſtication gratified the Palate.</p>
               <p>But why is Sin ſo dreadful? What is it that makes thy formerly pleaſing Tranſgreſſions ſo torturous in the Recognition? Truly this, God knows them, remembers them, is concern'd a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout them, engaged to animadvert upon them; his <hi>Juſtice and Wrath</hi> will not let them paſs; thou canſt not get through his hands, with thy Luſts about thee, as eaſily as they paſt through thine. Oh this is the ſting of Sin! 'tis a <hi>fearful terrible thing to fall into the hands of the living God.</hi> The unutterable Agonies and Woes of Hell, and the horrible Tempeſt of <hi>Divine Vengeance,</hi> and indig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation in everlaſting Burnings, which will be tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menting above all, that any underſtanding, but that of God, can comprehend; the bitter Weep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, Wailings and Gnaſhings of Teeth, without Eaſe, Releaſe, Mitigation, Relief, or End; this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tolerable after-clap of Sin, is even to the remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance and fore-thought, almoſt as Cruciating as it ſelf to the ſenſe and feeling will be confounding.
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:100687:117"/>God's Writing down all our Miſcarriages in his Book, out of which all the Power and Policy in the World can never expunge them; his ſetting even our ſecret Sins, in the light of his Counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, which makes them infinitely more viſible than the Sun in the Firmament; is a conſideration that ſticks and ſtabs us to the Heart, and Murders all our Comforts at once, and buries us in Hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror. Yet now, if there can be any good token found that this Hand-writing is blotted out. If a Man can be aſſured that Iniquity and Tranſgreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, ſhall by God be remembred no more, this is the moſt reviving tranſporting Solace in the World. But, how can I have a Teſtimony that God hath thus privileged me? How ſhall I know that he will forgive and forget my wickedneſs, if he do not tell me? Who can ſearch into the bottom of his Counſels, and know his purpoſes and practice in Heaven, if himſelf do not reveal them? And there are but two ways of revealing any ſecret thing, <hi>viz.</hi> by words and by works. Words ſpoken and written; Deeds in Signs. The Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Scriptures reveal God's general Will to par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don ſome, yet do they not name, but only de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe the Perſons, giving their true and lively Moral Character, ſetting down at full ſuch Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lifications, as may be to any Man a clear Evidence, who is, and who is not made happy in this foren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecal Mercy of Juſtification. If an Angel from Heaven ſhould addreſs himſelf to thee, with this Comfortable Meſſage, That thy Iniquities are par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned: If a <hi>Bath-kol,</hi> a voice in Thunder ſhould name thee, and ſay, Be of good Comfort, thy Sins are forgiven thee, thou could'ſt not be ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure, that this was not an Illuſion to abuſe thee into Preſumption, if thy inward ſenſe did not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:100687:118"/>thoſe tokens, on which the Word of God does ſuſpend thy Pardon: But if thou canſt but produce theſe, all the Angels and Voices from Heaven imaginable, though as particular and clear as poſſible, telling thee thou art unjuſtified, muſt be acknowledged, accurſed Deceptions, becauſe they Preach another Doctrine, than Chriſt has done in the Goſpel, <hi>Gal.</hi> 1.8.</p>
               <p>Well then, that thou may'ſt find a good token for good, thou need'ſt not aſcend into Heaven to ſearch the <hi>Archives,</hi> or court Rolls of the upper Bench there, nor turn over the Book of Life in a curious tracing out thy particular name; but having duly informed thy mind, what are the ſigns of a <hi>Pardoned State,</hi> look within thy Soul and Conſcience, and diligently enquire and exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine without Partiality, and a biaſs ſelfward, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the preſent State, Conſtitution and Frame of thy heart, be that in reality which is enrolled in the promiſes of the Book of God, the Scripture, which tender to thee Conditionally, the forgive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Sin, produce but thoſe Conditions, let it but appear upon ſound Evidence, that will ſatisfie thy ſelf and the World, and thy Judge; that having truly repented of thy Sin, thou liveſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Dominion of <hi>Faith</hi> and a good <hi>Conſcience;</hi> and <hi>Juſtice</hi> it ſelf is obliged to <hi>Faithfulneſs,</hi> for the granting thee Indemnity and Remiſſion, and the ſenſe thereof in thy own Soul. For if a Man can truly ſay, that he hath repented, and ſtands to what he has done, in ſtedfaſt Reſolutions, never to return to folly, his Reflections upon former Sins will not be torturing, though they may be grieving, becauſe he hath the promiſe of Mercy and Pardon, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 55.7. <hi>Acts</hi> 3.19. which Juſtice it ſelf is obliged to perform: For Conditional
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:100687:118"/>Promiſes in themſelves are Diſpenſations of free love, which was not obliged by any neceſſity or Congruouſneſs to offer ſuch Bleſſings upon ſuch terms; yet once made, and the Conditions obſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, the Donation of the Mercy becomes the inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt of ſtrict Juſtice and Righteouſneſs. But, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though the New Covenant admit of Repentance, which that of Works could not; yet this Conde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcention is only through a Mediator Jeſus Chriſt. If therefore to thy Penitence thou do not ſuperadd Faith in him, neither will thoſe after Thoughts be ſound nor introductive of Peace, becauſe with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Chriſt our <hi>Righteouſneſs and Peace</hi> objective and cauſal without us, <hi>Jer.</hi> 23.6. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.30. <hi>Mic.</hi> 5.5. <hi>Eph.</hi> 2.14. there can be no Pardon and Peace formal within us, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.1. and without Faith no Juſtification, no Chriſt, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.1. <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.18, 36. Yet both theſe muſt be evinced to be ſincere and ſound, and thereby be themſelves juſtifiable and juſtified; which nothing can do but the exerciſe of a <hi>Good Conſcience, Acts</hi> 24.16. This alone is to us the ſureſt Evidence, that our Repentance and Faith are unfeigned, and that we deceive not our own Souls. Indeed the baſis of all true bliſs and ſolace is a good Conſcience, in Juſtice and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocency toward Man, Inoffenſiveneſs and Piety toward God, Moderation and Sobriety in my ſelf; the contrary to theſe and Comfort are incompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tible. 'Tis but a colloguing with my Conſcience to my utter Confuſion to tender it Peace, if it be not pure, <hi>Jam.</hi> 3.17. No Man can be ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly quiet in Mind if filthy in Heart and Life. If thou be a Devil thou muſt carry thy Hell about thee, viſibly, or under diſguiſe in its ſelf, or its Cauſes. Thou haſt no juſt Right to the ſweets of Religion, if a ſtranger to its Power. A Mans
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:100687:119"/>firſt Deſigns for Joy, are, or ought to be laid in Self-ſurvey and Reflection. If he can find no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of God within, he can take comfort in no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of God without, but by an unjuſt Uſurpation and Sacrilege. All the goodneſs of God ſignifies nothing to an ill Man: But a <hi>Good Conſcience</hi> [or heart] is a <hi>continual Feaſt, Prov.</hi> 15.15.<note place="margin">

                  </note> He that finds all right at home, who has no rebuke nor cauſe thereof from the Domeſtick Comptroller and Comforter in his Boſom, is happy. Now, there can be no goodneſs in Conſcience but only from God, and as far as in Conjunction with God. God in thy Conſcience makes it good; for he is all Goodneſs, and there neither is, nor can be any except in, and from him. And all the goodneſs which is in thy Conſcience from him, is firſt from his Faithfulneſs, acting under his Love in the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, wherein he promiſes to give a <hi>new heart of Fleſh,</hi>

Next and under Faithfulneſs all the goodneſs in thy Conſcience is from Juſtice: For the Right that Fidelity gives to Mercy, Juſtice is obliged to maintain. God muſt perform his Word, becauſe he cannot deal fraudulently, that is unrighteouſly. If thou be good and holy, 'tis only becauſe God is Juſt and Righteous. He can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not paſs away a Right by Deed, Hand and Seal, and afterward reſume it. If we have thus made a Mercy thine, he will not defraud thee of it. Laſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and under all, Power actually confers upon thee, all that goodneſs that adorns thy Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence. Oh ſweet Combination and Harmony of Love! in all concurring to create thy Peace! Oh
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:100687:119"/>how valuable is it! that Love muſt unite ſo many Perfections, in ſo ſtrong an Engagement to qualifie thee for it, and then enrich thee with it, and the ſenſe of it. Here's the Glory and Crown of free Grace. Grace is free thus. 1. As nothing but God's free Will and Goodneſs mov'd him to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign ſo great unmerited Mercies, upon ſo mean and inconſiderable terms. 2. As nothing but his free Grace, without all deſert in us, prevails with him to work the Conditions themſelves and terms in us. But now, when free Grace has proceeded thus far, then Pardon, and Holyneſs, and Peace are not any longer free in this ſenſe, <hi>viz.</hi> reſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed wholly ſtill in his Power to withold; but by the Motion and under the Conduct of free Grace, as its Miniſters, Fidelity and Juſtice take up the Adminiſtration where free Grace left it: ſo that God cannot deny theſe Mercies, his Word being paſt, becauſe he cannot deny himſelf, and ceaſe to be faithful and juſt; that is, to be God. Thus, what is free Grace in the Original, Riſe, and whole proceſs mediately; is in the cloſing and compleating Acts thereof immediately Juſtice and Righteouſneſs. Thou Repentance and Faith be not claimable upon any account, but mere free Love; yet when this admirable Goodneſs has con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferr'd Repentance and Faith, it makes Pardon, Peace, Comfort and Heaven challengable, even in Juſtice (though not as merited yet) as Conditio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate Mercies. Whence the Apoſtle ſpeaks round<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, <hi>Heb.</hi> 6.10. <hi>God is not</hi> UNRIGHTEOUS, <hi>to forget your work and labour of Love.</hi> In ſome the Gift of the Conditions, Qualifications, Diſpoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons for Bleſſings, is only from free Mercy and Grace in God; whence thoſe Conditions in us are called Graces, the name of the Cauſe Metony<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mically
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:100687:120"/>given to the effect; Grace within us, from Grace without us in God: But the gift of the Bleſſings and Privileges themſelves upon per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance of the Condition is really Juſtice. Our abſolute poſitive State is from Grace, our relative from Righteouſneſs; yet ſuch Juſtice is alſo Origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally free Grace, becauſe 'tis not a natural Act of Juſtice but Voluntary. I mean ſuch Juſtice is not a thing, which God of himſelf by neceſſity of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture was ty'd to, antecedently to the free Engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of his own Will; but his free Mercy with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any other Motive, than its own Generoſity and Nobleneſs of Diſpoſition and Ingenuous Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, did pitch upon ſuch a Series of Diſpenſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons in boundleſs Wiſdom and Goodneſs, that (theſe Acts of Liberty interpoſing) Juſtice muſt needs be obliged to proſecute the beginnings of Love, and do ſuch things in order to our Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, as before thoſe Acts of Grace, it was not ty'd to at all; and this is chiefly done by the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpoſition of Faithfulneſs. An inſtance will ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der all more plain, it ſhall be that which we Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe of Comfort. Juſtice of its own Nature is not at all obliged to comfort a Sinner, though Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitent; but contrarily, the natural ſtate of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice engages it to puniſh Sin, not only with the Pains of Penitence, but Wrath and Vengeance, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though a threatning ſhould never intervene: For I ſuppoſe the threats to be in this different from Promiſes, that the former declare the natural, both right of the Law-giver, and dueneſs of the Penalty, and deſert of the Crime, which the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon and nature of the thing had fixed before, on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſince the Right was inveſted in the Law-giver, it was in his Power, upon juſt and valuable Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderations, to make a Relaxation, or Commuta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:100687:120"/>But, Promiſes do not declare, but give a Right, not to the Promiſer, but him to whom the promiſe is made, either abſolutely or upon Condition; whereby things are put out of his own Power, either abſolutely or conditionally. Now therefore, God by his Son has freely made this Declaration, <hi>Matth.</hi> 5.4. <hi>Bleſſed are they that mourn, for they ſhall be comforted.</hi> God cannot ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Falſhood, nor break Promiſe, nor withhold Right; hence 'tis, that the Adminiſtration here falls into the hands of Juſtice, upon the Interpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal of this free act of Mercy, in making the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe. Threats proceed according to the natural right of the caſe, in the ſubſtance of it, though they may vary from it in Circumſtances, in which the Puniſhment may be alleviated or heightened, at the Diſcretion of the Judge, or Solemnity, Pomp, Grandeur of the Matter and Proceſs. So Promiſes proceed according to the will of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſer, as to the matter or thing promiſed, which he may pitch upon, and chuſe at his own Arbitre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: But, when the Bond is once out of his hands, it may be Sued at the Bar of Juſtice; only he retains a liberty to Circumſtantiate his own grants, when he cannot recede from them in ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, the Right to which is not inveſted now in him, but the Perſons to whom the Promiſe is made. Comfort then he muſt in Juſtice give, 'tis the Mourners Right, if they be right Mourners. Mercy and Fidelity gave the Right, and Juſtice cannot diſannul it, although it be not a natural, but adventitious Right; and although this Juſtice be not the Original neceſſity of his Nature, but the free Diſpenſation of his Grace. For, <hi>Gon.</hi> 18.25. <hi>ſhall not the Judge of all the Earth do right.</hi> His Love has made this Juſt, and his Juſtice will give
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:100687:121"/>its due to his Love. That Eternal invariable Righteouſneſs, which is a ſteady fixed Propenſion, to render and diſtribute Right in all poſſible Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, and give all imaginable dues, is no changling in this Caſe, where the right and due is not any natural Reſultancy from the condition of the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, but a mere Condeſcention of undeſerved Grace: Juſtice may ſuſpend, but cannot over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw the Right of Mercy, but is obliged to own and obſerve it, upon account of the Sacrifice, and Merit of Our Lord Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Indeed, this is all the Foundation of a Believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers hope in Judgment: For Judgment is a Work of Juſtice, which diſtributes Dues, and particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly Rewards and Puniſhments according to Works. Therefore the Reward of Believers, is attributed to the ſame Juſtice that puniſhes Unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers, 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 1.4, 5, 6, 7. <hi>We our ſelves glory in the Churches of God, for your Patience and Faith in all your Perſccutions, and Tribulations which ye endure; a manifeſt token of the Righteous Judgment of God, that ye may be counted worthy of the Kingdom of God, for which ye alſo ſuffer. Seeing 'tis a Righteous thing with God, to recompence,</hi> 1. <hi>Tribulation to them that trouble you,</hi> 2. <hi>and reſt with us to you who are troubled,</hi> &amp;c. This, as well as the other is [<gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>] Juſt. 'Tis the Office of <hi>Juſtice</hi> to take notice in all its pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings of <hi>Right and Wrong;</hi> but if the Right ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove its reality, 'tis no Work of Juſtice to take Cognizance how we came by it, whether it be na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Inheritance, or perſonal Acquiſition, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther our own indefeiſible Poſſeſſion, or anothers free Donation, theſe are things Foreign, and out of the Circuit of Juſtice. <hi>Right</hi> muſt carry it, whatever be the Foundation of it, whatever be the Nature of it, whatever Title it proceeds upon:
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:100687:121"/>For no Varieties in the Right, alter the Juſtice of the Procedure, nor convert Juſtice into Inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice, or any other thing. The very Eſſence and Formal Nature of Juſtice as Diſtributive, conſiſts in diſpenſing Right: Whereever that is, the Act is formally Juſtice, and nothing elſe; although ſome other Vertue may have an antecedent Influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence in forming the Right. So here, No Man hath a Natural, Perſonal Right to that everlaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Reſt, neither do the beſt Services of the moſt perfect Creatures, Angel, Archangel, Cherubim, Seraphim, found a right to it, able in the nature of the thing, to command and neceſſarily over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rule ſtrict Juſtice, ſo as 'twould be Injuſtice pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly ſo called to withhold or deny it. For Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly Glory in its full Latitude (which I under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand by that Reſt) is a thing boundleſly above the Proportion of any finite Qualities or Operations. Thoſe ever Bleſſed Spirits are doubtleſly incapa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of exerting any Acts, that in Arithmetical Proportion, can be as conſiderable and valuable as the Reciprocal Actings of the Deity, that are return'd upon them. For inſtance, thoſe flaming Ardours of Love in Seraphims, which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nominate them, cannot in the Eſtimate of Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon and Juſtice be conceiv'd equally valuable, with thoſe reactions of Love in the Deity to them. Certainly God loves them better, than they can poſſibly love him; and his Love rays out to them in infinite more Varieties, than theirs can to him, and the leaſt degree of his Love, is more honour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able and worthy, than the higheſt of theirs: So that in Commutative Juſtice, they cannot expect his, for theirs; eſpecially ſince theirs is this due, and the Payment of a Debt cannot make the Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditor a Debtor. I have a Conceit, but will not
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:100687:122"/>impoſe it, that the Devils ſin was not an aſpiring to a Coaequality or Superiority to his <hi>Creator,</hi> which his Innocent, nay even Corrupt Underſtanding, could not but repreſent as impoſſible, impractica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, therefore not deſignable. But rather a chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge and expectation of thoſe Honours from his Maker, as due in Commutative Juſtice, to the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellencies and Actions which he admired in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and would have had his Inferiours to adore. Whence in that Kingdom of the Beaſt, which he eſtabliſhed and upholds, this is, or has been a principal Pillar, though now painted over a new; and is indeed the Univerſal Sentiment of all, in whoſe diſobedient hearts he retains the Domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, which he uſurpt upon the <hi>Fall.</hi> Even good Souls have a difficult Work to diſengage them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves from it. However 'tis madneſs to conceit, that the imperfect Duties or Graces of the lapſed Sons of <hi>Adam,</hi> can ſtand in a Parity with Coe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſtial Recompences: Nay, the Proportion can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not amount to the heighth of that call'd Geome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trical, proper to diſtributive Juſtice, which conſiſts in a likeneſs of Reaſon. For, can there be any compariſon betwixt finite and infinite, imperfect and perfect, temporal and eternal? Can any ſay, as the Work to the Wage, ſo is Duty to Heaven. The Right then here ſtands upon another bottom, than the reaſon of the thing, and that is the free inveſtiture and gift of Sovereign Love and Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, by a voluntary Grant and Covenant. 'Tis not common Soccage, but Copy hold only.</p>
               <p>Yet on the other hand, Hell and Sin ſtand more in a Parity, or equal Proportion. There is full as much evil in the Sin, as in the Puniſhment, though not as much good in the Duty as in the Reward. The demerit of Sin is unlimitable; the Treaſures
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:100687:122"/>of Wrath and Woe comprehended in it, are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>exhauſtible; therefore eternal. 'Tis juſt then to recompence Tribulation to the wicked, becauſe their Works merit it. Juſt to recompence Reſt to the godly; not becauſe their Works merit it, but becauſe free Grace hath promiſed it. <hi>Neh.</hi> 9.8. <hi>And haſt performed thy Words, for thou art Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous.</hi> God cannot be juſt to the Wicked, if he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward not their Works, he cannot be juſt to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, to his own Word and Covenant, if he reward not the Works he hath wrought in the Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous. Now even Troubles and Afflictions are leſs grievous, if recompence may be hoped for, upon good and ſure Grounds. If our Miſeries become Antidotes to greater Miſeries, it encourages our Patience; if they Work out greater Mercies, it increaſes our Courage, and ſo our Comfort. The gain ſweetens the pain, and we are not ſo much offended with our Croſſes, as pleaſed with the Compenſation. The World is as a Lottery, for a while we muſt draw nothing but Blanks, or what will more grievouſly vex, diſquiet, or tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment us; but the laſt caſt will pay for all, to our fulleſt Contentation, if we belong to God's Electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. <hi>For this light Affliction, which is but for a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, works for us a far more exceeding and eternal weight of glory,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.17. The happineſs of the recompence of Reward, is a thing of ſo tranſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent Nature, that even the ſerious Thoughts of it may entertain us with more abundant Joy, than there can be Grief in the feeling it ſelf, of the bittereſt Sufferings. The Antepaſts or Foretaſts of Heaven, are incomparably a greater delight than the very ſenſe of Miſery can be a Torment: Therefore ſure theſe exceeding glorious Riches of Coeleſtial Satisfactions, will be an all-ſufficient
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:100687:123"/>Requital for all the labour of <hi>Love,</hi> the patience of <hi>Hope,</hi> and work of <hi>Faith,</hi> that we exert in this Semibrief moment of our tranſitory Life. And it is no ſmall Comfort to conſider, that the Fidelity of God has made theſe Gratuities Juſtice, by making them the ſubject Matter of ſo many gracious Promiſes; that what otherwiſe was mere liberty, is now neceſſity; and God by vertue of theſe his Bonds, is become a Debtor to God. Oh rich Treaſury of ſtrong Conſolations! God's grace having ſo ordered it, not only that he may, but that he muſt give the penitently troubled Soul, in his own way and time, the ſweeteſt Peace, Comfort and Reſt. It may indeed be delay'd, but never can be finally deny'd; and this we owe chiefly to the Juſtice of God, his ſweeteſt Perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, through Chriſt, and the Covenant, to an humbled Soul.</p>
               <p>But there are alſo external Adminiſtrations of Juſtice, which are of a refreſhing conſideration, and ſuch did the <hi>Pſalmiſt</hi> reflect upon, and ſolace himſelf withal, Verſ. 1, 2, 15, 23. <hi>Vindictive Juſtice</hi> is a notable relief to the Oppreſſed, and the ſweetneſs of Revenge a potent <hi>Cordial.</hi> To ſee thoſe ſuffer from whom we ſuffer, and the Wicked fall into the trap and ſnare they lay for us, does not a little glad us; eſpecially if it be done by another hand than our own, that we are ſecure no guilt (therefore no ground of greater trouble) can cleave to us, in the requital of thoſe Evils, which they contract Guilt by inflict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon us. Therefore <hi>David</hi> Bleſſes God for preventing his avenging himſelf with his own hand, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 25, 39. But, is there an avenger like God? Who not only can and will vindicate his Peoples repute, from the ſcandal and reproach
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:100687:123"/>of the Malevolent, but revenge their wrong up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the ſturdieſt and ſtouteſt, that ſtrengthen themſelves in the Mountains of prey. For, he is engaged thereto, both by nature, as the God of Revenges, Verſ. 1. and by Office as Judge of the Earth, Verſ. 2. and alſo by Covenant and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, <hi>Deut.</hi> 32.35, 36, 43. <hi>Rom.</hi> 12.19. <hi>Venge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance</hi> is mine: <hi>I will repay ſaith the Lord.</hi> He will proſecute the injurious with a vindictive hand; and this is no ſmall Comfort, to ſee a perfection in God throughly engaged, and active to plead our cauſe againſt the wrongs of Men, when their heighth and power procure for them indemnity, that to ſeek, or even think to regain our right is formidable. Hence we muſt not, cannot avenge our ſelves; nor is it fit we ſhould. We are not wiſe and good, and juſt enough to be entruſted with a matter of ſuch moment, as Judgment in our own cauſe. Where we feel hard hands, we know not hearts, therefore cannot fathom the deep abyſs of malignity therein, nor conſequently meaſure out, and proportion our Puniſhments to Crimes in their full or right Dimenſions, but muſt be conſtrain'd to leave ſomething to God; and why not all? We ſhall be prone to act our own Paſſions, rather than execute Juſtice, and by over-doing out of ſelf-reſpects, or under-doing with reſpect to Perſons; expoſe our ſelves to the revenges of Heaven, which needs not our wrath or wrong, to work its Righteouſneſs, nor will over-look our miſcarriages without due Animad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion. But, if we commit all to him that Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es righteouſly, we ſhall have right our ſelves, and do no injury to others. And it will <hi>be no grief, ſtaggering, ſtumbling, or offence of heart to us, that we revenge not our ſelves,</hi> 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 25.31. (which
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:100687:124"/>implies how much that might trouble us) but a Satisfaction and Comfort, that it lies in his hands, who both can, and will do it, and time it for the beſt, <hi>Luk.</hi> 18.7, 8. 'Tis the fate of Innocency to have the weakeſt viſible intereſt on Earth. <hi>The Wicked walk on every ſide:</hi> Their Numbers, and Powers, and Policies, and Malice combine againſt Holineſs, and for the moſt part oppreſs it, <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 4.1. and 8.14. and 5.8. but yet it ſhall riſe when they fall, be glorified when they are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned; and though the guiltleſs, oppreſſed, meet with no comfort or Comforter on Earth; they have both in Faith and Hope, and may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce and triumph, in proſpect of the Day of the <hi>Lord,</hi> which will both right and recompence the wronged, beyond their utmoſt Imaginations; <hi>they ſhall be comforted</hi> over all the Evils they have ſuffered, while <hi>the other are tormented.</hi> Thus does Juſtice adminiſter Comforts, in reverſion to the outwardly afflicted, by the injuſtice of Men, and in poſſeſſion to the inwardly Wounded, by the mixt actings of the Mercy and Juſtice of God. Thus are all Comforts, as products of Love or Rightcouſneſs, the fruits of gratuity, liberty, or neceſſity in God.</p>
               <p>§. 4. The <hi>Omnipotence</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> as Executor to his Mercy and Goodneſs, Executioner to his Ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance and Juſtice, does not carry an aſpect of Terror, but comfort to a Holy Soul. Even out of this Eater comes their Meat, and out of this ſtrong ſweetneſs. 'Tis able, and the Perfections upon whoſe errand it goes, engage it to fetch our Comforts out of, even their contraries, and convert our Corroſives into Cordials; much more to derive and deduce them out of their Cauſes, out of all their Poſſibilities. This helping hand,
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:100687:124"/>was one of the <hi>Pſalmiſt</hi>'s encouraging Supports, and gave no little eaſe to his Heart, Verſ. 17, 21. With what an undauntable courage did <hi>Achilles</hi> adventure himſelf into all perils, in confidence of his caſe-hardned impenetrable Armour; the aſſurance that he was out of danger, that no Weapon could make a breach upon his Vitals, was the ſtrongeſt ſupport to his Magnanimous Heart. But, What are Braſs and Steel and Adamant, to the impreg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable Defences we enjoy in God? Our Buckler and Shield, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 18.2, 30. <hi>Gen.</hi> 15.1. <hi>Deut.</hi> 33.29. <hi>Prov.</hi> 2.7. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 28.7. and 33.20. and 91.4. and 115.9. and 47.9. and 84.11. and 144.2. <hi>Prov.</hi> 30.5. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 3.3. <hi>A Shield about me;</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Verſ. 6. <hi>I will not be afraid of Ten thouſand of People, that have ſet themſelves againſt me round about:</hi> And here, Verſ. 22. <hi>The Lord is my de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence.</hi> Here's a Security unparallell'd, Armour in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed unpeirceable. The Body of Chriſt is truly invulnerable: <hi>No Weapon formed againſt it ſhall proſper,</hi> Iſa. 54.17. Nothing can reduce it into the State of Mortality. <hi>The Gates of Hell cannot prevail againſt it,</hi> Matth. 16.18. nor againſt the meaneſt Member thereof, becauſe <hi>built upon the Rock. If Chriſt dwell in thy heart by Faith, and thou in him by Love,</hi> Men may rage and Devils ſtorm againſt thee, but the Rock cannot ſhrink under thee. The Ship cannot ſink that carries Chriſt within the hope of Glory. The Covenant is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>expugnable, Grace inextinguiſhable, God's Love unchangeable, his purpoſes irreverſible. Thou art unconquerable becauſe God is. Forſake not this thy Defence, be not a Traytor to thy ſelf, and nothing can hurt thee; nothing can wreſt thee out of an Omnipotent hand, and whilſt in it nothing can ruine thee, though Fury and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:100687:125"/>may kill thee; yet it does not damage thee, it does but only render thy happineſs immutable, it does but only bring thee back to the felicity thou loſt, reinſtate thee in Paradiſe and Innocen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, nay, advance thee above it, in Impeccability and Immortality. And, to what more can the loftieſt Ambition of Humane Nature aſpire? To be free'd from all Evil, and enjoy all good, is the ſubſtance of that Felicity, which the moſt enlarg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Appetite pants after. And the Omnipotence of God is all things real and poſſible. There can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be a created deſire commenſurate to its abili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to ſecure us, or ſatisfie us. It is a proper and all-ſufficient remedy, againſt the Diſconſolateneſs, which may ariſe in our Hearts, through two of theſe kinds of troubles, in our Thoughts, which I inſtanc'd before, <hi>viz.</hi> the dreadful and deſpair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. Nothing can poſſibly be ſo formidable, as to be capable of being a match for Almightineſs; nor can there be the leaſt ſhadow of reaſon to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpair of any thing, if infinite Power undertake it. To be ſafe from fear of Evil, is a wonderful Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction. Danger of all kinds muſt be removed, or we are not ſafe; the fear of all remov'd, or we do not think our ſelves ſafe, and the conceit does torture as much as the thing, which diſqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ets no further than as apprehended; and the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence ſometimes, becomes more grievous than the feeling. But, where can there be ſafety, if not in an Omnipotent hand? Where without it? <hi>He is the Rock of my refuge,</hi> ſays the <hi>Pſalmiſt,</hi> Verſ. 22. <hi>The Name of the Lord, is a ſtrong Tower, the Righteous runneth to it, and is ſafe,</hi> Prov. 18.10. and 29.25. and 21.31. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 4.8. &amp; 12.5. <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finiteneſs</hi> is an impregnable Fortreſs, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 18.2. Here have we the comfort of being above the reach
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:100687:125"/>of Malice, in a quiet and ſecure <hi>Sanctuary.</hi> Build thy Tabernacle here, and nothing can endanger thee; make ſure of an intereſt in this, and thou haſt no reaſon to be afraid.</p>
               <p>But if thy Fears be not blown over, yet a ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lid Hope may waft thee into Paradiſe. This is a thing that in the greateſt hazard will buoy up a ſinking Heart, and the more grounded our Hope, the more refreſhing. Cut the Cable and looſe this Security and we float a drift without Card or Compaſs, in a bottomleſs Gulf of Miſery. No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing ſo deadly as Deſpair. 'Tis the utter wrack and ruin of all our Joy. But if we have good reaſon to expect liberation from an unſupporta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Evil, or to wait for the communication of a ſatisfying Good, or of the continuance of its En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyment, ſo that a ſufficient compenſation will be made us in this, for the hurt we received by the former; or if the evil invading us cut off our hopes of preſent recompence; yet if we be cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain of a competency of ſupport and ſuccour, or that we ſhall not feel it in the full amplitude of its malignity, but with abatement and mitigati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that it ſhall only have a ſhort being, but no biding and reſt upon us, that we ſhall ſee through it, we are leſs ſolicitous in our Minds, and herein feel no little relief. Now what a ſafe ground have our Hopes to anchor upon in God's Almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tineſs. Here's all Hope, nought to be deſpair'd of. What is there not to be had in boundleſs Perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on? What may not be hoped for from omnipo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent Goodneſs? Can there be any capacity in a finite Being, to which infiniteneſs cannot extend? Can there be a rational expectation in a limited Nature, to which unlimited Grace will not accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modate it ſelf. The unfathomable excellency of
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:100687:126"/>God declares him all-ſufficient to anſwer thy ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectance to the full, and his free gracious Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municativeneſs and Promiſe, render all thy hopes from him rational. Thou canſt not deſire, much leſs expect, more than God can give, and he is willing to grant more than thou canſt hope for. Nothing in thee can be the meaſure of his un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meaſurable Power and Bounty, in diſpenſing what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever may be for thy good, and 'tis not rational Hope, which is not guided by this diſcretion, to look for nothing but what is good in it ſelf or to us. For evil is not appetible, and what is not the object of Deſire, cannot be of Hope, but Fear. Now the Judge of what is Good or Evil in it ſelf, or to us, is not our Fancy, or Appetite, or Luſt; but the unbiaſſable Wiſdom of God.</p>
               <p>We muſt therefore have recourſe to that pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erful Hand, which is the <hi>Agent</hi> and <hi>Factor</hi> for ſuch unconceivable Wiſdom and Grace; and what cannot that do in our troubled Hearts, which both in Heaven and Earth can do all things, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding abundantly <hi>above all that we ask and think, Eph.</hi> 3.20. It can both prepare us for Comfort, by conquering our enmity againſt it, indiſpoſition for it, unſuitableneſs to it, and by creating thoſe Qualifications and Conditions, which are prerequiſite to our enjoyment of it; and alſo prepare it for us, and apply it. Is thy ſtate ſo bad that thou canſt not be duly comforted? Almightineſs can change it by regenerating thee, <hi>Eph.</hi> 1.19, 20. with 2.1.

The effect muſt needs be remov'd, with its immediate continuing cauſe; they cannot be kept and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerv'd without a Keeper and Reſerver, continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his influence for that end, as the Light cannot ſubſiſt if the Sun, Moon and Stars be taken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way.

<pb n="231" facs="tcp:100687:127"/>thus give Reſt and Quiet, and thereby Peace and Comfort, what Power can controll him, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy his Work? ſurely none. And why? the reaſon is to be deduced from his Almightineſs. All the Malignancy and Enmity of Earth and Hell, though in a confederacy of united Virulence, Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licy, Power, and Violence, indeavouring to make a breach in, or of that ſecure Peace, wherewith a <hi>Good Conſcience,</hi> as a Brazen Wall, doth guard, fortifie and ſurround a true Servant of God, by a Commiſſion deriv'd from Heaven, will but be like the vain attempts of the impotent Waves againſt a <hi>Rock,</hi> which inſtead of overturning it only daſh themſelves in pieces.</p>
               <p>Without the interpoſure of Omnipotence, the Comfort of ſinful Man would be impoſſible, in that order of Government which Divine Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom hath pitch'd upon, as moſt congruous for his Salvation. For ſuppoſing Sin, and God's pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe not to permit all Mankind to periſh everlaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly, under that Juſtice, into the Hands where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of the adminiſtration of his Kingdom did neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarily fall, upon the Apoſtacy of Man; and ſuppoſing God's determination, to uphold the honour of his Juſtice and Government in pardon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing none but upon Conſideration, and in virtue of a ſatisfaction given to Juſtice; I affirm, 1. That ſatisfaction could not poſſibly be made for the injury done to God by Sin, except only by Omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potency. For Death being threatned for Sin, the threatning in the ſubſtance of it muſt be execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, or both Juſtice and Fidelity violated. For ſince in the nature of the thing ſome Puniſhment cannot but be due for ſo high an affront to the Divine Authority and Regiment, and ſince the Commination had determin'd and expreſt the
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:100687:128"/>kind of Puniſhment in ſubſtance to be Death with an <hi>Emphaſis:</hi> How could the Deity be juſt in his Word, or his Deed, had all been wholly wav'd? Therefore the Satisfaction given muſt be by ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering the Penalty to the full, in its ſubſtance. The Threatning doth not expreſs any thing con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the greatneſs, extenſive, or intenſive of the Puniſhment, only that it be proportionable to the Crime Juſtice requires. The Crime is vertu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally infinite. The Condition of the Creature will not admit of a Puniſhment intenſively infinite. Therefore the Death threatned can only be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſively infinite, that is Eternal. But an eternal duration that has a beginning is not actually in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite, vertually therefore. The Sin then being ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually infinite, the Puniſhment proportion'd and threatned muſt be vertually infinite alſo, <hi>i. e.</hi> as infinite as the ſtate of the Creature was capable to admit. If now this, <hi>viz,</hi> an <hi>Aeviternal Death,</hi> be inflicted in kind, becauſe an end of it is impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible, there could not poſſibly be any Satisfaction, any Salvation. Satisfaction therefore muſt be in another kind of vertually infinite ſuffering, <hi>viz.</hi> that intenſively ſo. And 'tis very conſiſtent with Juſtice to admit this Commutation, ſince it has its full demand therein, <hi>viz.</hi> a Puniſhment proporti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onable to the Fault, <hi>i. e.</hi> vertually infinite. But now nothing ſhort of Omnipotency, or infinite Power can bear, or wreſtle thorow a Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment infinite, or which is Omnipoenal.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Neither could any Power leſs than infinite, raiſe the Satisfier of Juſtice from the Death Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral, which was indiſpenſibly to be undergone by him, and to this 'tis aſcribed, <hi>Eph.</hi> 1.19, 20. to be preſently tranſcribed.</p>

Wherein God
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:100687:129"/>willing more abundantly to ſhew to the Heirs of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe the immutability of his Counſel, confirm'd it by an Oath; That by two immutable things, in which it is impoſſible for God to lye, we might have ſtrong Conſolation, who have fled for refuge, to lay hold up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Hope ſet before us.</hi> No ſtate is perfectly comfortable that is changeable for the worſe. Be our Contentments never ſo refreſhing, yet the fear to be deſpoil'd of them will introduce a ſecret ſting and bitterneſs which will allay their Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſantneſs, and ſo much the more, by how much the ſweeter they are, and yet the more, as the parting time ſtill approaches nearer. But when it comes indeed the torment and anguiſh in their loſs is ſo intolerable, that the ſatisfactions of our forepaſt Enjoyment are utterly obliterate and forgot, like the ſeven Years of Plenty in <hi>Egypt;</hi> and we are ready to wiſh rather never to have felt them, than ſo to be deprived of them. <hi>But now the Nature of God not admiting the leaſt variable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs or ſhadow of change,</hi> Jam. 1.17. <hi>And all the Promiſes of God, being in Chriſt, yea and in him A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,</hi> 2 Cor. 1.20. <hi>And the Gifts and Calling of God being without Repentance,</hi> Rom. 11.29.

Though we believe not, and ſo the Promiſe be not fulfill'd to us in particular, becauſe we obſerve not its condition, yet this will be no impeach to the Fidelity of God, but rather a confirmation of it. For if the Mercy were granted, where the condition on which 'tis ſuſpended is not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed; God would not act according to his Word which is conditional, but would appear to change both his Word, and that whereof it is a
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:100687:130"/>Declaration, <hi>viz.</hi> his <hi>Will</hi> and <hi>Purpoſe.</hi> God's Promiſes therefore are of an invariable Nature, becauſe he himſelf is ſo. Abſolute Promiſes ſhall undoubtedly be fulfill'd abſolutely, Conditional, conditionally, not otherways, becauſe God is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changeable. Heaven and Earth ſhall paſs away but of his Word not a Jot or Tittle. <hi>For it is for ever ſeated in Heaven,</hi> Pſal. 119.89. <hi>His Faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs therein is to all Generations,</hi> ver. 90. His Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes are a ſure never failing Foundation. For even thoſe Promiſes which in their immediate Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture are conditional to particular Perſons; yet to the Church in general are made Abſolute, becauſe the Condition it ſelf is promiſed. <hi>For he that has en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged that the Church ſhall not be extirpated and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed,</hi> no not by all the Malignity and Violence of the Gates of Hell; has oblig'd himſelf to ſuch a ſeries both of ſpecial and common Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences as will infallibly ſecure it both from inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal corrupting Principles, and external deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Powers.

               <p>To every Promiſe there's an anſwerable pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe in the Will of God.

As therefore the Decree to pardon and ſave Men, is Conditional, but the Decree to create in them the Conditions is abſolute; ſo alſo 'tis in the Promiſes, which are therefore immutable, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Decree, the Will, the Nature of God is. Whence Divine Veracity ſtabliſhes and fixes our grounds of Comfort, from the reſt of God's Perfections, and adds new poyſe and weight to the Balance, without which, all our Mercy is on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:100687:131"/>Liberty, and our Expectation nothing but ſtrong Imagination, our Faith Fancy. For what have we to do to hope, that a Majeſty ſo exalted, and eminent, will in a peculiar manner, above the courſe of ordinary Providence, (or indeed in that) concern himſelf about us, till he declare it? And what conſidence can we have in any Declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, if we have no aſſurance of Fidelity in the Revealer? Sinners have nothing in God intereſted about them, but vindictive Juſtice and its ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervient Attributes, whilſt they continue under the Firſt Covenant, and reject the terms of Grace. Men may declaim what they will at rovers con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the merciful Nature, and boundleſs Goodneſs of God to his Creatures; 'tis acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged they are unſpeakably Rich and Glorious; but though they be the neceſſity of his Nature, eſſentially conſidered, yet their egreſs and flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out into tranſient Acts, is Arbitrary and mere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Gratuitous. His Nature is all Love, and Kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and Goodneſs; yet theſe are not the next ground of Hope. Go preach this Doctrine in Hell to the Apoſtate Angels, extol the Mercy of God as high as the higheſt Heavens, Rhetoricate upon it with the Tongue of a Cherubim, through all the Varieties and Flowers of an Invention as large as the Univerſe, as lofty as the Sky; make them believe if you can, that they are under the diſpenſation of Grace, that infinite Bowels will not permit any of his Creation to be finally Miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable; ſee whether you can mock them into hopes of Salvation, with ſo comfortable an Oration. No, there can be nothing but Deſpair where no interpoſal of God's Faithfulneſs. Goodneſs and Love, be they never ſo unmeaſurable and free, do but only contribute to the height of the
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:100687:131"/>Miſery of thoſe who having forfeited all the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent Fruits of them, cannot find or expect a return of their Embraces and Bleſſings in the hand of Veracity. For the remembrance of loſt Happineſs does but only Torture and Crucifie, with the more grievous and anguiſhful Reflecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, if there can be no retrieval; and none can poſſibly be ſecure, that Mercy once forfeited and loſt ſhall again be preſented to his choice, and acceptance till Fidelity be engaged, that his Faith and Hope may ſtand firm upon the bottom of a Promiſe. But upon the intervention of this At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute, if there be a bond upon the Truth of God, there's one alſo upon every other Perfection of God. <hi>Wiſdom,</hi> and <hi>Goodneſs,</hi> and <hi>Juſtice,</hi> and <hi>Power</hi> and all; even the very Being of God is laid in pawn, and every thing in God muſt ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve to the intereſt of Veracity, all concur to obſerve and accompliſh its Obligations, all are reſponſible for it; ſince 'tis no more poſſible that God ſhould be a <hi>Lyar,</hi> than a <hi>Fool,</hi> Wicked, Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>righteous, Impotent, Nothing: Fidelity there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore is in a more ſpecial manner every Attribute of God, becauſe every one is under a ſpecial voluntary bond, to ſtand by it, over and above the Natural. For though 'tis true, that there is no real difference in God, but all that is repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented to our infirm Faculties, under diſtinct Notions is in him, one omnifarious, ſingle indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſible Excellency, producing various Effects from whence it has its various Denominations; the one uncompounded Divine Eſſence, as wiſely managing all things, in Himſelf, Heaven, and Earth, being call'd <hi>Wiſdom;</hi> the ſame undivided Eſſence as Loving being called <hi>Goodneſs;</hi> the ſame alſo as diſtribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting Right being call'd <hi>Juſtice;</hi> and as Effecting
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:100687:132"/>all things call'd <hi>Power,</hi> and immutably engaging in <hi>Promiſe, Faithfulneſs;</hi> one and the ſame <hi>Being,</hi> in the moſt perfect ſimplicity of Nature, is all; which Unity of Attributes I call the <hi>Natural Bond,</hi> that binds them; and the Plurality being merely nominal not real, is only inſtanc'd in ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodation and condeſcenſion to our imbecility and ſhallowneſs of Underſtanding; yet to ſuble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate the ſame impotency in us, and beget the firmer Confidence and ſtronger Conſolation, the <hi>Holy Ghoſt</hi> does aſſociate Divine Perfections and Actions, throughout all his inſpired Writings, in an Engagement for us. <hi>As thoſe two immutable things, Heb.</hi> 6.17, 18. both which, <hi>viz. Counſel</hi> and <hi>Oath,</hi> being mere ſpontaneous bonds, yet are bottom'd upon and derive their Immutability from ſomething in God that is of Natural Neceſſity, <hi>i. e.</hi> his Unchangeable Nature; but are combin'd in a ſtrict voluntary Union, (I mean depending merely upon the Will of God) to confirm our aſſurance of Mercy. So here, that Wiſdom, Goodneſs, Juſtice, and Power, which no neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Nature did oblige to own ſinful Man, with any gracious Condeſcentions, are all by the free act of God's Will, which nothing but mere Grace mov'd him unto, (<hi>viz.</hi> by his <hi>Counſel</hi> and <hi>Oath</hi> the bonds upon his Veracity) ſo immutably en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gag'd to act in ſubſerviency to his purpoſes of Love, that they cannot be themſelves, if thoſe Counſels obtain not. Thus thoſe <hi>Perfections</hi> which are naturally one in Eſſence, are voluntarily made to be one in Efficience; as they are one in Nature, ſo freely made one in Operation; whilſt by the gratuitous and unneceſſitated Act of God, all are ty'd to a concurrence in obſerving the deſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and ends of <hi>Faithfulneſs,</hi> this voluntary
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:100687:132"/>Bond he hath laid upon himſelf, evidencing <hi>that</hi> to be his free choice, which is the neceſſity of his Nature; that as 'tis abſolutely impoſſible in it ſelf that God ſhould be a <hi>Lyar:</hi> So there may not be the leaſt imaginable ſhadow of a reaſon for us, neither to make him one, by our unbelief, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 5.10. But our unbelief may be rendred utterly and eternally inexcuſable; nor to make him evil and unloving by our Diſconſolateneſs, but his boundleſs graciouſneſs under the conduct of his trueneſs to his Promiſe, may re-eſtabliſh our Comfort upon an everlaſting Foundation; that as the matter of our Joy and Conſolation is treaſured up in that inexhauſtible Magazine of all delectable Sweetneſs and Satisfaction, the <hi>Goodneſs of God;</hi> ſo his Veracity may be a moſt certain and infallible means to ſecure it for us, and aſcertain us, that in Gods due time, we ſhall enter upon the full, and perpetual enjoyment of it.</p>

If the accidental Society of any be ſweet, much more this Elective; neither is the Natural and Relative inferiour, eſpecially where the Love is not meer Liberty, but Neceſſity.

Good Words with a good God are gladſome indeed. O take pleaſure in the Meſſage, more in the Meſſengers, in the Sender moſt of all. The inward ſecret whiſperings of the Spirit of Grace and Peace in thy Conſcience, the outward publication of Peace by God's Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters and People, are only in the matter and me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod of the Scriptures, in which alone, God rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſpeaks Peace. Nothing can comfort but Truth, nothing ſavingly Comfort but Scripture Truth. All truth is originally from God, Eſſential Truth is God, the Son of God, <hi>Mat.</hi> 28. <hi>ult.</hi> who is, where-ever he ſpeaks and maks that comforting Truth, which is his Image, efficacious by his Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:100687:136"/>and Power, ſo that the very Inſtrument of Comfort, does but only delight us relatively to him of whom it is a lively Repreſentation. Thou mayſt be mock'd with a Lye, and bewitch'd into a falſe deceitful Joy, with a Falſhood, but when the Mask is taken off, thy bare Countenance will appear more ſad than at firſt, and thy Comforts more unretrievable. No real Peace, but in the God of Peace, through the Prince of Peace.</p>
               <p>Friends and Relations cannot alway be preſent perſonally, with their Company and Counſel to miniſter to our Peace. A Vertual and Vicarious Preſence and Conference, does not a little contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute to our Conſolation, when diſtance of place, renders the other impoſſible; and with what a tranſport of Joy do we receive their Tokens, their Letters, their Writings, with what a <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>, do we peruſe, and in a manner greedily devour them? How are our Hearts raviſhed with the kind and affectionate Expreſſions, Profeſſions of Remembrance, Reſpect, Love; every Word is a Cordial, we are in an extaſie of Contentation, here as in a Glaſs we behold them, their lively Portraicture is afreſh painted hereby in our Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination; we hear them, we talk with them, ſolace our ſelves in this Phantaſtical Enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment as if it were Real. And why ſhould not our Delights be more tranſcendent in God, who can never be abſent; whoſe Preſence is Subſtance, and not Phantaſtry; and whoſe Tokens of Love, and Letters of Comfort, are not the <hi>Curates</hi> of a <hi>Non-Reſident Being,</hi> nor the Miſſives of a diſtant Superintendency; but the immediate Viſitations of an Overſeeing Care and Love, that naturally minds and regards our higheſt Concerns, and

               <p>How comfortable is good News of any kind, what a reviving to our drooping Hearts? With what paſſion do we long for it? With what glad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs receive it, believe it, bleſs God for it? The <hi>Goſpel of Chriſt</hi> is better News than the beſt on Earth: Glad Tidings of the greateſt Joy, Peace, Love, and Life. Here mayſt thou ſee the omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form motions of Chriſt's richeſt Grace, perceive the compaſſionate workings of his Bowels, feel the ſolicitous beatings of his affectionate Heart, in a tender regard of thee; read of the aſtoniſhing effects of his wonder-working Power and Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, all the Miracles of his Love and Kindneſs, for thy Good, in Illumination, Sanctification, Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtification, Salvation; what he hath done, what he ſtill is doing, what he further will do, to raiſe thee up, out of the bottomleſs Pit of unſpeakable Miſery, to the top and crown of Heavenly Feli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city and Glory. Well might the Apoſtle tell of the <hi>Comfort of the Scripture,</hi> Rom. 15.4. And <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid long for it,</hi> as a means to his ſolace, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119.82. This and this alone is the richeſt Promptua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, fulleſt Treaſury, of all real Soul-ſatisfactions, hence have we them, or they are but mere Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerdemain, and Illuſions. And if the very News of Chriſt be ſo ſweet, what is he in himſelf? What is he in Perſon? None have reaſon to ſay of him, as the <hi>Corinthians</hi> of <hi>Paul,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.10. <hi>His Letters are weighty and powerful, but his bodily Preſence is weak.</hi> His is not the preſence of a weak contemptible Body, but of an all-powerful Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, he that can be Omnipreſent, cannot but be Omnipotent. Chriſt as God is in all, is all, and even as Man full of Vertue, a touch of his very Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:100687:137"/>wrought a Miracle of Healing, <hi>Matth.</hi> 9.20, 21, 22. And if in his Mortal Body there was ſuch Power, what is in his Immortal and Glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied. The Principle I know was Heavenly, though the Veſſel Earthly; yet this has loſt nothing by its Exaltation to the Throne of God, no nor we neither, for in lieu of that Corporal Preſence we enjoy a no leſs Comfortable Companion, the <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raclete,</hi> the Holy Comforting Spirit of God, to abide with us, not for a few days, and years, but for ever, <hi>Joh.</hi> 14.16. So that although our ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Relation be gone to Heaven, yet are we not <hi>Orphans, ver.</hi> 18. <hi>The Angel of God</hi>'s <hi>Preſence, Iſa.</hi> 63.19. that ſaves us comforts us now by <hi>Proxy,</hi> yet is not abſent from us, but eſſentially with us, though Corporeally at a diſtance from us.</p>
               <p>Gods Natural Preſence is an immenſity of Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, Unconfinable to any Place, Incomprehenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble by all Places, Exterminable out of none; and with its fullneſs filling all in all: So that there is no need of the ſupplement of any thing to avoid a vacuity, nor is any thing by this Being excluded, that needs a Place. He is in all Space, and beyond all Space, not commenſurate with it, but infinite; The Dimetient of all, yet without Meaſure, and all Corporeal Dimenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; boundleſsly greater than all things, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehending all within the Circle of his Eſſence, whoſe <hi>Center is every where, Circumference no where;</hi> in all Varieties of Co-preſent Beings, the ſame invariable Perfection, no other on Earth than in Heaven; that he can without any altera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in himſelf, or varying of his place, make Heaven to be any where, every where; therefore the Joys and Comforts of Heaven: For, I reckon that Heaven does not import any difference in
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:100687:137"/>God, but in us; no change in his Being but our Viſion; no new Object, except Chriſt's Fleſh, but new Eyes. Every Spirit (and therefore the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of Spirits) hath a Power to conceal its Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, as well as its Sentiments, from all other Spirits, except God: Yet there's a difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the Latency of other Spirits, and the Deity. A finite Spirit is hid through the ſuſpence of its Agency <hi>Ad extra,</hi> its acting upon things without it ſelf; ſo the Deity cannot be hid. For, if it wholly ceaſe to act upon any Being, that Being will wholly ceaſe to be, <hi>becauſe all live, move, and have their Being, in and from Him,</hi> Acts 17.28. which Spirits that ſee not with Eyes, but Intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lects cannot but perceive; only 'tis unobſerv'd by Man, whoſe Mind looks through the Apertures of Senſe; which together with it ſelf being dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned through Sin, has but very obſcure and weak Reflections upon that Being, without which he cannot be; 'tis hid to him by a Veil of Fleſh, that envelops his Intellectual Eyes, or elſe he ſhuts, and will not open them to behold this inviſible Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; which is in reality, more conſpicuous and evident, that is, knowable than any thing in the World whatever. But, the Deities concealment of it ſelf, is with reſpect to ſome more ſpecial Voluntary Operations, which give Teſtimony to his preſence, and demonſtrate the Finger of God; which when ſuſpended he is (and therefore the Comfort of his preſence is) hid from our Eyes. Such are either Miraculous or Gracious: For al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though every thing in Nature, both in reſpect of his Being and Agency, be a ſufficient Indication of the Exiſtence, Preſence and Efficiency of God; it being impoſſible that any Natural Powers ſhould exert themſelves in a ſuſpence of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:100687:138"/>of his; the Concurrence whereof gives them to be what they are, and do what they do: Yet the Deity, ſometimes, as being it ſelf the Law of Laws, does in its Actings, vary from, go be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide, nay contrary to the common and ordinary Laws of particular <hi>Natures,</hi> and ſo invert the courſe and order of things, as to give peculiar evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of his Preſence, and Power by Effects, won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfull ſurprizing and aſtoniſhing: As the Flood of <hi>Noah,</hi> the firſt that falls within the Cognizance of Hiſtory after the Creation. I need not parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularize more, the Scripture is full, nor balk that, for all the ingenious attempts of a late Author, to deduce it from Natural Cauſes, it being de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrable, that ſome neceſſary parts of his Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potheſis, ſtand in need of the violence of Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle, or the whole proceſs will ſtick, and produce nothing.</p>
               <p>Yet the Manifeſtations of the Divine preſence, which conſtitute Heaven, are not in the inſtances of Power, but Goodneſs; even as the Diſcoveries of it in Vindictive Juſtice form the Miſeries of Hell. That Goodneſs and Juſtice eſſentially con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered, which make Heaven and Hell are Omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſent, as being the Divine Nature. But, the Objects of them cannot aſpire to an Ubiquity, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of a limited Nature. Should they circulate through all the Regions of <hi>Immenſity,</hi> the condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and ſenſe they partake, would preſent them ſtill with the ſame unaltered, unalterable Nature of God. Heaven and Hell would be in every place, where Souls ſo ſenſed reſide; the Diſcoveries of God importing no change in him, but only in thoſe to whom the Diſcovery is made: Heaven and Hell not being more the alteration of our State, than the awakening of our ſenſe to diſcern,
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:100687:138"/>and apprehend, and feel that, which before we did not, though before it was the very ſame im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mutably, and will continue ſo everlaſtingly.</p>
               <p>This is the Natural State of Heaven, but the Chriſtian State is ſomewhat more: For the choi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſt, ſweeteſt Diſcoveries of God are therein made, in and through the Mediator God-Man, and in ſpecial to Mankind, through the Manhood of Chriſt; which being of a limited preſence ſettles the Divine Manifeſtations, in a certain limited place, ſufficient to comprehend all Elect Angels and Men. This Divine Preſence we enjoy by Faith here, by Sight hereafter. We have as much of God and Heaven now, as we have of Faith. Divine Manifeſtations are proportioned to our Believings. All the Effects of Divine Goodneſs, in, and upon us, depend upon this Chriſtian Grace, and the degree of them, upon the degree of it. Gain but this, and thou haſt God and all. Nothing can pierce the Heavens, but this Eye. 'Tis the [<gap reason="foreign">

In Heaven thy preſence, Chamber where thou ſit'ſt upon the Throne of Glory, cloathed with Honour and Majeſty as with a Garment,</hi> and diſcovereſt and diſplayeſt the Splendour of thy incomprehenſible Excellency and Perfection: And <hi>at thy Right Hand, where thou haſt ſaid, my Lord ſhould ſit till his Enemies be made his Footſtool,</hi> Pſal.
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:100687:139"/>110.1. In and through this Jeſus, at thy Right hand are pleaſures everlaſting. But, theſe are chiefly the Comforts of a Future State; Is there not ſomething at preſent to ſtay, and yet inflame the Appetite? Yes, verſ. 8. I would always poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſs that Saturity of Joys, which is before thy face. Therefore, <hi>I have ſet the Lord always before me, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he is at my right hand, I ſhall not be moved: Therefore my Heart is gladed, and my Glory [Exults] re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyces; my Fleſh alſo inhabits in hope, becauſe thou wilt not leave my Soul in Hell, nor give thy merciful [or excellent] one to ſee the pit of Corruption, but thou wilt make me to know the path of Lives— He is at my right hand,</hi> and therefore <hi>Gladneſs and Joy in my Heart and Soul.</hi> But, Oh what is there at <hi>His right Hand!</hi> My Faith ſetting him now as preſent before <hi>me,</hi> brings ſingular Satisfaction and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light? Oh then, what will ſenſe and ſight be, when I ſhall poſſeſs the reality of that which I now believe. The reſult is, That the preſence of God, apprehended by Faith, or Viſion, is a thing which comprehends the ſubſtance and fulneſs of all Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, Joy, and Conſolation.</p>
               <p>Indeed, nothing Comforts, but through ſome kind of preſence: It either is, or is conceived to be and made, indiſtant by our Cogitations. Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Infirmity requires ſomething in hand, or in hopes that are as ſecure, and therefore as good as in hand. Abſence of a ſolacing good, although only imaginary, is tormenting. God cannot but be near every one of us in Eſſence, and we find him ſo to be by the effects of his Goodneſs. Since then he is at our right hand naturally and neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarily, we muſt voluntarily by Conſideration and Faith ſet him before us, have an Eye upon his preſence, fix it in our Minds and Meditations al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way:
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:100687:139"/>And it will repleniſh us with Spiritual re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſhment and ſolace unſpeakable. For, if <hi>God he with us, and for us, who, or what can be againſt us?</hi> What can trouble or terrifie us? How can that Soul be left in a Hell of diſquiet, that lives in the preſence of God, <hi>i. e.</hi> in Heaven? For, where God is, there's Heaven; he is the all of it, 'tis no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing without him, and his preſence is enough to convert any thing into Heaven. There cannot poſſibly be ſo much Evil in thoſe Infernal Regions of Wickedneſs and Woe, as there is good in the preſence of God. 'Tis an infinite good. There is not ſo much Power in Hell it ſelf, to impreſs the ſenſe of its Evil upon a tormented Soul, as there is in God, to impreſs the Comforts of his preſence upon a gracious Heart. Neither doth the Juſtice of God more enlarge the Capacity of a Man, to ſenſe, and anguiſhfully apprehend and feel the Miſery of his abſence in Hell, than his goodneſs doth widen the Soul's Capacity, to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend the felicity of his preſence in Heaven; that I Judge the Saints to be more happy above through their Inheritance in Light, than the Damned are miſerable in outer Darkneſs.</p>
               <p>In the Omnipreſence of God we have with us, all Things, all Perfections, all Satisfactions, all that ever God can be, or do, or give; and in his gracious Preſence we have an Ingagement upon him, to be, do, and give all that he can to us; And what can we wiſh, what can we imagine more? God is <hi>All-preſent</hi> by condition of Nature, but graciouſly preſent only by Compact and Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, whereby he obliges himſelf to be our God; that is, every thing which he is in himſelf, that we ſhall enjoy the benefit and comfort of all, and every of his Unimitable Soul-ſatisfying and
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:100687:140"/>ſaving Perfections. Now the gracious Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of God is nothing elſe but his manifeſting himſelf to be with us, by his Communicating all Covenant Mercies to us: Making us Partakers of a Divine Nature, granting us Pardon, Peace and Comfort; giving us the full uſe and advantage of all his Attributes, of his Son, of his Spirit; eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry thing that he is, and hath, which will do us any good for this and another World; ſatisfying us with his likeneſs, and filling us with Joy un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpeakable and full of Glory.</p>

In every Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture there is a natural inſtinct and preſſing deſire, inclining to return to the place of its Birth, to that Country, to thoſe Perſons which had its Maiden Affections. Notwithſtanding the Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of reaſon in our ſelves, 'tis no little Grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication to our Fancies, to enjoy a retiring place, and home, where we may refreſh our ſelves after all our weariſome Labours and Travails. Where-ever we are beſide, we are not well, here are our Hearts, our Delights, our Joys; whence we ſay <hi>Proverbially, Home is Home though never ſo homely:</hi> And the Spaniards.</p>

               <p>Our Spirit is from God, in his boſom was it born; there is our <hi>Houſe, not made with Hands,</hi> 2 Cor. 5.1. our Eternal Manſion, and is there not infinitely more agreeableneſs and pleaſingneſs, in him to our Souls, than there can be ſweetneſs and ſuitableneſs in any material Home to our Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginations. We do not inure our ſelves, <hi>by Love to dwell in God,</hi> 1 Joh. 4.16. therefore are ſo well content to be abſent from him, to ramble like Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gabonds, chuſing the Life of <hi>Cain</hi> or <hi>Coryat</hi> ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than that of Chriſtians and Saints, whoſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and bideing, ſhould be ſolely, and electively in God as it is eſſentially and naturally. On for ſuch a Diſpoſition of Soul, as would never permit us to be at eaſe, but in ſerious Reflections
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:100687:141"/>upon the preſence of God, with which we are e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſurrounded whether we will or no: And if we conſider this, how can we be any other, than Engarriſon'd in Peace, and Joy, and Conſolation? Well might the <hi>Pſalmiſt</hi> ſay, <hi>Thou comforteſt me on every ſide,</hi> Pſal. 71.21. for round about him and within him alſo, dwelt a Comfort no leſs than infinite, the Supreme <hi>Majeſty,</hi> able, and of Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority to command the preſence of all <hi>Good,</hi> and countermand the preſence of all <hi>Evil;</hi> and the <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereign Mercy</hi> of Heaven, willing, and of ſufficient <hi>Love</hi> and <hi>Fidelity,</hi> to make every thing a means of Grace and Peace, and all things (according to his Promiſe) <hi>Work together for good, to the true Lovers of him, and the called according to his purpoſe,</hi> Rom. 8.28.</p>
               <p>§. 7. Laſtly, <hi>The Eternity of God</hi> is a ground of Comfort, as fingular, as it ſelf is incomprehenſible. Everlaſting Conſolation is built upon no other bottom. A periſhing Content is in effect none, becauſe it iſſues in nothing but the greater diſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction. The durableneſs of our Joy, is its Crown; and ſince 'tis in the Eternal God, it can be no other in Duration than what he is. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore as there <hi>is in God's preſence a ſaturity or full<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Joy,</hi> in reſpect of Magnitude and Inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiveneſs: So at <hi>God's Right Hand pleaſures for ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more,</hi> in reſpect of extent and continuance. And 'tis probable our <hi>Pſalmiſt</hi> might derive ſome of thoſe Comforts, which did bear <hi>ſo favourable an Aſpect upon his troubled Soul,</hi> as verſ. 14. does not obſcurely intimate; <hi>For the Lord will not caſt off his People, neither will he forſake his inheritance.</hi> The Negative excludes univerſally, perpetually, <hi>He will never caſt off nor forſake;</hi> it alſo infers the Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmative, <hi>He will own, and accompany his People, and Inheritance for ever and ever:</hi> Which he is en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abled
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:100687:141"/>to do only by vertue of his Eternity. Poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly that Expreſſion, verſ. 22. may alſo import ſomething of like nature; <hi>My God is the Rock of my Refuge.</hi> He could not be unacquainted with the Song of <hi>Moſes,</hi> and the Bleſſing he pronounc'd upon the Twelve Tribes, <hi>Deut.</hi> 32. and 33. There are theſe Titles firſt of all given to God. <hi>Rock</hi> in the Song is five times apply'd to the Lord, verſ. 4, 15, 18, 30, 31; twice to Idols, verſ. 31, 37. But, that which I have chiefly in my eye, is Chap. 33.27. <hi>The Eternal God is thy refuge;</hi> very proper and Emphatical: For 'tis the Eternity of God, that renders him a ſufficient, and compleat Refuge. Notwithſtanding all other Perfections, if he were not the Everlaſting God, our Refuge would finally fail, and be none at all. He is call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>The Rock of Ages,</hi> which our Tranſlation ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders <hi>Everlaſting Strength,</hi> Iſa. 26.4. And indeed a <hi>Rock</hi> the moſt indiſſoluble and durable part of the Earth, is an Emblem of perpetuity, <hi>A Rock of Refuge,</hi> is therefore an everlaſting ſecurity and comfort. Nor is it a mean Satisfaction to remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, that as there is a ſufficiency of Ability and good Will in our God; who by Covenant is engag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to put an end to our troubles, and repleniſh us us with the Joys of his Salvation: So he lives for ever to continue them, that they ſhall have no period ſhort of Eternity. He is an ever-over-flowing fountain, of <hi>Everlaſting Conſolations,</hi> as they are called, 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 2.16, 17. <hi>Now our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, and God even our Father, who hath lov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed us, and given us everlaſting Conſolation through Grace: Comfort your Hearts,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Our Conſolations are Eternal, becauſe God is, for in him they are as in the Well-ſpring, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore cannot be as <hi>Waters that fail;</hi> as <hi>Jerem.</hi> Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtulates,
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:100687:142"/>Chap. 15.18. If they could, <hi>our Wound might be incurable indeed, refuſing to be healed, and our pain perpetual.</hi> But, all this ſhall certainly have an end, becauſe God cannot: This cannot be Eternal, becauſe God is. Whatever is want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the durableneſs and ſweetneſs of theſe flux<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ible, periſhable Enjoyments, which we poſſeſs on Earth; whatever we ſuffer, through the conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuance and bitterneſs of our Calamities, is made up, and amends made us abundantly, in the Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rennity of all Excellencies in God.</p>
               <p>There is in this Attribute, a ſuitable relief in all kinds of Diſtreſſes, outward and inward. All the ſhort liv'd Comforts of this World, have a better Being and Life in the Eternity of God. Thou loſeſt thy Friends and Relations, the ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt, the beſt; perhaps by the immediate hand of God, as the <hi>Pſalmiſt</hi> here by the violent hands of wicked Men, verſ. 5, 6. The Church of God in ſome places is laid waſte, and the ſtormy Cloud hangs over more, and its implacable reſtleſs Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries threaten all. The <hi>Innocency</hi> of Chriſt's Lambs is no Protection againſt the <hi>Thrones of Iniquity,</hi> in <hi>Babylon</hi> and Hell, verſ. 20, 21. No, that's the very ground of the Quarrel and Enmity. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity to them, Innocency and Iniquity would reconcile them. Do'ſt thou <hi>tremble for the Ark of God?</hi> And is thine own Perſonal Jeopardy or Suffering in Body, Mind, or Eſtate, in any ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremity? Be not diſinay'd. <hi>Nubecula eſt cito tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitura:</hi> The greater the Tempeſt, the ſooner o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver.

The <hi>Dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gons Flood</hi> will be ſoon ſwallowed up, and the fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of Men and Devils ſhall quickly faint and melt away, but the Love of God to his choſen, never, never. Iſa. 40.27, 28. <hi>Why ſayeſt thou, Oh</hi> Jacob <hi>and ſpeakeſt Oh</hi> Iſrael? <hi>My way is hid from the Lord, and my Judgment is paſſed over from my God? Haſt thou not known, haſt thou not heard, that the Ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting God, the Lord, the Creator of the ends of the Earth, fainteth not, neither is weary, there is no ſearching of his underſtanding?</hi> Therefore poſſeſſes he an unfathomable Skill, and Ability to refreſh and revive thee; but this is laid as the Foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Stone, upon which thou may'ſt rebuild thy de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caying hopes, <hi>viz.</hi> that he is the <hi>Everlaſting God.</hi> I therefore return again to that, <hi>Deut.</hi> 33.26, 27, 28. <hi>There is none like the God of</hi> Jeſhurun, <hi>who rideth upon the Heavens in thy help, and in his Excellency on the Skie. The Eternal God is thy refuge, and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neath are everlaſting Arms, and he ſhall thruſt out the Enemy from before thee, and ſhall ſay, Deſtroy them.</hi> Iſrael <hi>ſhall then dwell in ſafety alone,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Happy art thou, Oh</hi> Iſrael, <hi>who is like unto thee, Oh People, ſaved by the Lord, the ſhield of thy help, who is the Sword of thy excellency,</hi> &amp;c.

<pb n="262" facs="tcp:100687:143"/>where it ſhall only enjoy its everlaſting Crown. The Fire upon the Altar of God, will be inex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſhable, if from Heaven; and thoſe Coeleſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Sparks of Divinity, or Grace, which the Holy Spirit kindles, will by the bluſter and ſtorms of Affliction, conceive a more vehement Flame; pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh and die, they cannot, as long as God lives, from whom they derive their Being and Eternity. But, ſuppoſe all other ſweet Satisfactions, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Spiritual Joys and Refreſhments, or Tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Contentments be totally extinct as to preſent ſenſe; yet finally they ſhall not, becauſe they poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſs a perennity of Life in God: And when <hi>Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs</hi> and <hi>He</hi> meet in the Superiour World, theſe will revive, and Miſery die. I grant the moſt flouriſhing Gourds of Earthly Pomp and Glory, may wither in a Night, as being a vain Pageant, and mere Phantaſtry, <hi>Acts</hi> 25.23. The faireſt, freſheſt, ſweeteſt Flowers, of the Youthful Spring, of Humane Life, may be blaſted in a moment, and converted into duſt and rottenneſs: The moſt pleaſing Sun-ſhine of the ſmiling Morn, of a for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate Proſperity, may ſuffer an Eclipſe, and iſſue in a diſmal Hurricane of inſupportable Calami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties: Nay, Heaven it ſelf may ſeem to frown, and a dark Cloud to cover the Light of God's Countenance, <hi>Lam.</hi> 3.44. But, none of theſe Evils can extend beyond the Grave there are they buried, and with them <hi>Sin,</hi> their Cauſe, never to have a Reſurrection: Then dawns the Day of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verlaſting Light and Bleſſedneſs, and all Dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, Dolours and Shadows flee away. Be our Miſeries as great as they will, or can, they cannot outlive Mortality, if our guilt do not, and it ſhall not if true Repentance live within us. At the day-break of Eternity we enter upon a Life of
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:100687:143"/>Contentation and Peace, as endleſs, as tranſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent. The Death of our Bodies, is the Death of our Troubles, and the Reſurrection of thoſe Joys, over which Death hath no Power. As there will then be no more beginning of Wretchedneſs, ſo no end of Felicity. The worſt turn that the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil, and his Inſtruments can do us, will turn to the beſt advantage, and thoſe Souls that die to the Body, ſhall live in Chriſt; they are uncloath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of Dirt and Putrefaction, that they may be for ever Cloathed with God and Glory: That as the Death of the Body, is the eaſer of all our Pains; ſo the No-death or Immortality ſucceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, is the Introducer and Maintainer of an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boundable Fullneſs, of everlaſting Soul-Satisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. This we owe to the perpetual Duration and Life of God. Whence the <hi>Pſalmiſt,</hi> in a ſad Proſpect of the evanid Nature of preſent Things, doth ſolace himſelf with a view of the permanent Being of God, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 102.11, 12. <hi>My days are like a ſhadow that declineth, and I am withered like Graſs: But thou, Oh Lord, ſhall endure for ever, and thy Remembrance to all Generations. I ſaid, Oh my God, take me not away in the midſt of my days, thy years are throughout all Generations. Of old haſt thou laid the Foundation of the Earth, and the Heavens are the Work of thine Hands: They ſhall periſh, but thou ſhalt endure; yea, all of them ſhall wax old as a Garment, as a Veſture ſhalt thou change them, and they ſhall be changed: but thou art the ſame, and thy years ſhall have no end.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>We are poſſeſt of many Tranſitory Comforts, but of none Eternal beſide God: And if any true Content ariſe from thoſe movable Enjoyments, it ſprings from nothing elſe in them, except that, which being eminently in God, is in him of an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verlaſting
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:100687:144"/>Nature and Perfection: Whatever plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, doth ſo far refreſh and comfort; but all that pleaſantneſs, is only a little ray of Divinity, tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted through the Cloud of Fleſh and Blood, or the more clear Heavens of our Rational Powers. Amiable Relations are Comforts, beyond all things under the Sun; but their lovely Qualities are only a dark Shadow of the unparallell'd Amia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleneſs of God. To be beloved by thy Friends is a Comfort eſtimable above Gold, but neither the Act, nor the Object durable, no, nor the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive exciting or inviting that Affection. Can any Man Rationally ſolace himſelf with a Being lov'd for a moment, when he ſhall be deſerted or hated for ever? Fading Love on Earth will not do, without the never fading Love of Heaven: Though all the World for a while adore thee, What com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſating Pleaſure can that bring thee, if Hell ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſtingly burn thee? All thy fore-paſt Joys on Earth will rather add new Fewel, than adminiſter one drop to cool thy flaming Tongue. No Love there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore is indeed conſiderable and comfortable, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the Eternal Love of God: Nor in the aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of this is any hatred or rage valuable, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecting, formidable. As Eternity is the Venom and Sting of the Torments of Hell; ſo 'tis the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Triumph, Jubile, and Heaven of the Joys of Heaven. If in the loſs of theſe lauguiſhing expir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Comforts, we can ſuccenturiate or ſubſtitute any thing of God, we richly gain by the loſs as poſſeſſing unſpeakably more pure, ſubſtantial, heart-reaching, durable, everliving Comforts, in the everliving Spring; who can, and will give them that reliſh and ſweetneſs, which ſhall abundantly more than anſwer, what is ſlip'd away from us, as well in its delicious Gratefulneſs, as
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:100687:144"/>Eternity. Mortality is the great diſgrace of all Worldly Enjoyments, but it receives a plentiful Compenſation in the Immortality of God.</p>
               <p>Thus have I conſidered the Comforts compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended in thoſe Attributes of God, which offered themſelves to the <hi>Pſalmiſt</hi>'s Meditation, as I find them either expreſt, or plainly implied in this Pſalm.</p>

<pb n="266" facs="tcp:100687:145"/>to Conſideration. What was needful to be obſerved concerning <hi>Promiſes,</hi> fell in under <hi>Divine Fidelity,</hi> as included in its very Notion, therefore ſhall all further Diſquiſition anent them be ſuperſeded.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Providence</hi> is the tranſit of <hi>God's Wiſdom, Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, Juſtice, Goodneſs, Faithfulneſs,</hi> out of Heaven, and himſelf into the viſible World, Governing, Protecting, Caring for, Directing, and Ordering all, for moſt excellent Ends, worthy of God. Under the conduct hereof, all things proſperous, or adverſe, the greateſt, the moſt minute, Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural, Moral, Spiritual, neceſſary or fortuitous are deduced from their immediate proper Cauſes, guided and ſuſtained in their Actings, ſecured from external Violences, maintained in a due ſteady, agreeable Station, and order to compoſe the Beauty and Harmony of the Univerſe, and be conducible to advance the Glory of their Maker, in both the general and ſpecial purpoſes of his Love and Goodneſs, or Juſtice and Righteouſneſs. And there is not a more reviving conſideration to <hi>God's afflicted, toſſed with tempeſt, and not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forted,</hi> Iſa. 54.11. than this, that they are the peculiar care and charge of Heaven, which as it is concerned for the <hi>Catholique</hi> good, ſo in ſpecial for <hi>thoſe that love God, and are the called according to his purpoſe,</hi> Rom. 8.28 inſomuch, that Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperity cannot be more delectable to their ſenſe, than Afflictions of all kinds are made to their Souls uſeful and profitable. 'Tis always beſt for them to be in the worſt external Circumſtances, as ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver being more dear to God, more regarded by him, who is moſt tender of them, when the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil and World are moſt cruel, and when the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſts, off-ſcouring, and refuſe of the Earth. When
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:100687:145"/>here they can expect nothing, beſide Reviliags and Buffetings, the liberal Alms of the Churches Enemies, they are likelieſt to receive the more bountiful taſtes of Divine Goodneſs, poſſeſs more of his Grace, as a Preparation for more of his Glory, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.8. to the end.</p>
               <p>Upon this <hi>Providence of God,</hi> our <hi>Pſalmiſt</hi> had a ſpecial eye throughout the Pſalm: Whatever he deſires and prays for, whatever he believes and hopes for, whatever he acknowledges and praiſes God for, whatever he bemoans and afflicts his Soul for, whatever he experiences and feels, was ſome Act, Effect, or Permiſſion of Providence That God in the courſe of his Providence, would an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimadvert upon the inſolent Barbarities of his, and the Churches Enemies, is the Expoſtulatory Petition of Verſ. 1, 2, 3, 4. What was the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion of <hi>Providence?</hi> Is the condolement and moan of Verſ. 5.6. The ſingular concern of Providence, is the Doctrine of Verſ. 8, 9, 10. as the happy Fruits of the very Severities thereof, the Triumph of Verſ. 12, 13, and the returns of its favourable Aſpect, the belief of Verſ. 14, 15, the notable, needful, ſuitable, and feaſonable In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpoſals thereof, the experience of Verſ. 17, 18, 22, and the turning of this great <hi>Wheel</hi> upon the Adverſaries to their confuſion, the Prophetick hope of Verſ. 23. All jointly, together, the comfort of the Text, which <hi>in the Multitude of his perplexed Thoughts, did look with ſuch an amiable re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard upon his Soul:</hi> So that although the Fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal. Ground and Matter of his Satisfaction, was the Nature of God, in all its plenitude of Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection; yet the more immediate Spring thereof, was the Egreſs or Iſſuings out of thoſe Attributes, in all theſe Varieties of <hi>Providence.</hi> And the truth
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:100687:146"/>is, although what God is in himſelf be eminently and vertually all Comfort in the utmoſt degree of Excellency; yet ſhould he confine his infinitely de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lectable Glories to himſelf only, and never ray out, and communicate of his Beauty, Grace, and Life to his Creatures, they would be utterly at a loſs for Happineſs. 'Tis therefore not only the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of this Supreme Goodneſs, as it tranſcends all in Perfection: But, alſo 'tis its practice and delight, and higheſt end; the very thing, that is called God's Glory, which he has a prime reſpect to in all his Actings: For, then have his Creatures the higheſt Motives to Honour him, when they taſte moſt liberally of his bounty, in the nobleſt Inſtances, and he glorifies himſelf, in the Eſtimate of the World, when he is moſt beneficial; as the Sun is moſt glorious, when diffuſing, without any Interception, his benign rayes and influences: All which Glories vaniſh, as to us in a total Eclipſe, or his deſcent under the Horizon.</p>
               <p>Hence then does our Joy, and Peace, and Solace actually germinate and grow, even from the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of Divine Perfection, branching out it ſelf, in infinite methods of <hi>Providence,</hi> wherein he diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes to us of his own fulneſs, according to our va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Exigences and Appetites. The out goings of his Wiſdom, Goodneſs, Juſtice, Fidelity and Power, in ſweet and ſuitable Bleſſings and Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports, that in every Condition we can behold ſomething of God, of greater value and conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, than either our Mercies or Croſſes. This is a potent Cordial to our Diſconſolate Hearts, and repleniſhes them with wonderful Contentati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. If theſe Divine Glories compaſs us about, care for us, keep us, we are <hi>comforted on every ſide,</hi> Pſal. 71.21. <hi>Yea, though we walk through the Valley
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:100687:146"/>of the Shadow of Death, if God be thus with us,</hi> in his providential Efficiency for our good, <hi>his Rod and Staff will comfort us,</hi> Pſal. 23.4. <hi>Rod and Staff</hi> Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoral, not Judicial or Corrective, as ſome under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand it. But, <hi>Providence</hi> being vertually includ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in thoſe Attributes, whereof it is an effect and iſſue in diſcourſing of them; I was unavoidably led into ſome conſideration of it alſo.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>The Privileges</hi> which adminiſter Conſolation in the greateſt hurry and perturbation of Thoughts are many; Two whereof only are inſinuated in this <hi>Pſalm,</hi> yet ſuch as ſuppoſe more. They are, 1. <hi>Sanctification.</hi> 2. <hi>Propriety in God and aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurance of it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>Sanctification</hi> by the Word and Spirit of God, is an excellent ground of Conſolation. 'Tis in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed the firſt Foundation Stone laid in the Fabrick. In vertue of this we receive Comfort from other things. Tell any diſquieted Heart of the inex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hauſtible Treaſures of everlaſting Joys and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſhments in God the <hi>Father, Son, and Holy Ghoſt,</hi> That Multitudes have enjoyed on Earth, and in the Eternal Fruition whereof the Bleſſed Saints and Angels ever triumph in Heaven; which the boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and goodneſs of God exhibits and offers to all: Tell it of the free and gracious Promiſes, and Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of God, that tenders the ſweeteſt and ſtrongeſt Conſolation: Exhort with the moſt charming <hi>Rhetorick,</hi> and raviſhing <hi>Suada,</hi> to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace theſe ſo rich, ſo profitable, ſo neceſſary Proviſions of abounding <hi>Love:</hi> Alas! it cannot, it dare not: Why? Becauſe 'tis Preſumption, 'tis Stealth, Robbery, Sacrilege, to ſnatch away any thing, to arreſt theſe Divine and Holy things without Right. But have you not Right? No: How do you prove that? 'Tis plain: All Right
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:100687:147"/>is founded in Sanctification. I am not Sanctified; I lie in my Sins, dead and buried in Guilt and Wrath, unregenerate out of Covenant, as not having ſubmitted to its Conditions, in <hi>Repentance, Faith,</hi> and <hi>New Obedience:</hi> Therefore the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts of the Covenant, and of the Promiſes, its Branches, do not at all appertain to me. This Argument cannot be gain-ſaid, if it aſſume right. 'Tis undoubtedly true, That none have Right to the Mercies of the Covenant, who do not ſubmit to its terms; and that very yielding unfeignedly to the terms, is an act of Sanctification, which neceſſarily ſuppoſes the Communication of a Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple, becauſe none can act grace ſincerely, except from an inward Life of Grace, it being eſſential to the ſincerity of an Act, that it proceed from a gracious Diſpoſition, from a renewed ſanctified Heart:<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Ezek.</hi> 36.26, 27, 31, 32. and Ch. 20.43, 44. and Ch. 11.19. <hi>Jer.</hi> 32.38, 39, 40. and 31.31, 32, 33, 34. and 24.7. <hi>Deut.</hi> 30.6. <hi>Acts</hi> 5.31. and 3 26. <hi>Phil.</hi> 1.29. <hi>Eph.</hi> 2.8, 9, 10.</note> For none but acts of Life (as contradiſtinct to <hi>Dead Works</hi>) entitle to the Promiſes. God gives a Heart of Fleſh, a new Heart, and Writes his Law there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, infuſes his <hi>Fear</hi> and <hi>Love</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>into, gives Repentance through the Exaltation of Jeſus Chriſt; to whoſe benignity we owe the Donation of Faith alſo, and are altogether his Workmanſhip, created in Chriſt Jeſus to good Works, that we may walk therein evermore. Admit that theſe Promiſes and Aſſeverations were deſigned primarily for <hi>Iſrael</hi> according to the Fleſh: Yet can it not be denied, that they deline<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate and deſcribe the manner, and method of God's Proceedings with his <hi>Iſrael</hi> according to the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit. For he no where declares his intent, to alter
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:100687:147"/>that oeconomy of Grace in the ſubſtance there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, which was eſtabliſhed by the Covenant of Grace, to reduce loſt Man to the obedience of the Juſt, though the Circumſtances and Ceremonials vary. Now if acceptable (that is ſincere) Acts may iſſue from any Man, without, or antecedent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to all holy Qualifications, or Habits (as they are uſually called)' twere a ſupervacaneous, need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs, fond thing, for the Deity to promiſe them, or intereſt his own Agency about them, which yet is of a blaſphemous importance, as 'twould ſavour of the higheſt Arrogance to imagine, that I am in a Capacity to act well-pleaſingly to God, without God. For does it conſiſt with the Divine Wiſdom, and God's Ingenuous procedure with Man, to promiſe what is in Mans power, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he promiſe or no. And if we be capable of exerting one acceptable Act without Divine In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence, Why not another and another, till fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent Acts produce a Habit, and all this exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſively to the aids of Heaven?

If his Grace be found real and ſound, his Repentance, Faith, and Love unfeigned, his Heart is at eaſe, he has a perfect Demonſtration, that God the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is his God and Father, Jeſus Chriſt his Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our, becauſe the Holy Ghoſt has been his Sanctifier. Now does he not doubt of the pardon of his Sins, of the ſpecial Love of God, of an intereſt in all the Benefits purchaſed by Jeſus Chriſt, of a Right to all the Promiſes, and everlaſting Conſolation and Salvation.

               <p>Now that the Pſalmiſt had ſome Reflections upon his Sanctification, in aſſuming to himſelf the Comforts of God, ſeems evident from the 21. verſ. where he makes a tacit Profeſſion of his <hi>Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs</hi> and <hi>Innocency,</hi> which no doubt were to him, as in like caſe they are to any Man a ſingular Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port and Satisfaction, under all the Calamities and Cruelties endured, through the violence and fury of Man. Though the Floods, and Waves, and Storms beat high from without, yet if there be a ſweet Calm within; though the World with a ſavage barbarouſneſs perſecute and purſue me

This is a ſingular rejoycing and ground of Comfort, though <hi>our ſufferings abound,</hi> Verſ. 5. The Peace of a good Conſcience, is a powerful Antidote againſt the Poiſon of all adverſe accidents: For ſince nothing diſeaſes, diſquiets me, but only as far as it gets within me, and no external Occurrents can be ſo great Evils; as internal Sanctity is a good, becauſe the utmoſt that the fiery rage of Earth and Hell can do againſt me, is but finite, whilſt under the conduct and influence of real Holineſs, I am ſecure, that I do, and ſhall enjoy the all-ſufficient Reliefs of infinite goodneſs, and therefore my Miſeries only commit a Rape upon my imaginative and iraſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cible Powers, whilſt my Comforts are ſeated deep in my Rational, which through Divine Grace have regain'd the Soveraignty; it neceſſarily follows that the potency of all outward Evils to torment me, is boundleſly ſhort of the Omnipotency of that Internal Heaven, that I feel in my conſcience to content and eaſe me, and my Sorrows will be perfectly run down by my Joys and Conſolations. But then, this I muſt acknowledge, that neither can my Conſcience be good, nor I comfortably Innocent (<hi>i. e.</hi> neither acting nor imagining evil againſt Men) nor Righteous (<hi>i. e.</hi> deſigning and doing all the good I can, out of an inward prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple of Love and Juſtice) unleſs I be truly a Sanctified Perſon.

               <p> Here then is the very Root of all Spiritual Comfort. For <hi>trouble of Conſcience</hi> (which is its contrary) is founded by Sin. The Filth, the Guilt, the Power afflict and wound our Spirits. If theſe be removed, the ground of the trouble va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhes; and if we have an inward feeling, and aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurance, that they are removed, the trouble it ſelf is actually taken away. Now <hi>Pardon</hi> is the taking away the guilt of Sin, we have no reaſon to fear the Wrath to which it did bind us over; and <hi>Sanctification</hi> is the taking away the <hi>Power and Filth</hi> of Sin in us. I ſay [in us] for <hi>Sanctification</hi> doth not aboliſh the filthy Nature of Sin in it ſelf, but rather diſcover it to us more abundantly, to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cite our abhorrency and loathing, and this very Deteſtation is the main of our cleanſing from the filth of Sin; this waſhes away that ſtain, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with our Souls were blemiſhed, that is, God deals with us as if there were none, is as kind and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourable to us, and as freely converſes with us, as if we never had been polluted, and will conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue ſo to do till we renew the defilement. For the ſake of Chriſt he overlooks all thoſe ſpots and deformities, the turpitude and diſgrace whereof made us cover our Faces in ſhame, before his pure, all-diſcerning Eye; and he looks upon us, and we look upon our ſelves, as clear, unblamable, and beautiful in his Eyes, when we really hate thoſe Evils that have defiled us, and (as the ſpring of that hatred, without which it can never be, nor be pleaſing to God) when we are repleniſhed with the Riches of his Grace, and adorned with the Robes of his Sons Righteouſneſs; for both concur to our acceptation. <hi>Sanctification</hi> alſo de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroys the Commanding, but not at firſt the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belling, the Regal, but not Tyrannical Power
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:100687:151"/>of Sin; though it be our ſtrength even againſt this, and at laſt will aboliſh it. It ſo ſubdues our Luſts, that they ſhall not Reign, though they may reſiſt as contumacious Enemies. They are look'd upon as Traitors to be deſtroy'd. That is, our ſtrongeſt and moſt delightful bent of Will, being for God and goodneſs againſt Sin; we ſin not out of Love to ſin as dntiful Subjects obey their Sovereign out of love to obedience. Yet ſo maſterful and imperious are our Corruptions, that they will fight againſt us under their Chains, and taking their advantage, knock us down and raviſh us; that according to <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.18. to the end, we ſometimes <hi>do that we would not, or do not that we would, our delight being in the Law of God, after the inner Man,</hi> which no unregenerate Man can truly ſay. But the <hi>Law in our Members</hi> does [<gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>] counterwar and captivate; and <hi>Sin dwelling in us</hi> does overbear our moſt determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate purpoſes in ſome particular Act, although for the-main, and in the general courſe of our lives we keep it under, alway diſlike it, are af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted with it, would give Worlds to be rid of it, and uſe God's appointed means for mortifying it, that we may gain an abſolute Victory: Though it may get the better in ſome ſlighter skirmiſhes, yet we remain Maſters of the Field. In brief, when Sin has our liking, allowance, love, delight, 'tis a King; when not a Tyrant. The former is inconſiſtent with <hi>Sanctification,</hi> not the latter; therefore does not debar our right to <hi>Pardon and Peace,</hi> though it may darken our Evidence, and ſo damp our Comfort. But if we enjoy this aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, that God is ours, we have Evidence alſo that Grace is ours, Pardon is ours, Peace is ours, and therefore <hi>may ſolace our ſelves in its abundance,</hi>
                  <pb n="280" facs="tcp:100687:152"/>Pſal. 37.11. As on the contrary, antecedently to this aſſurance, there can be no ſecure and well bottomed, although there may be a fallacious and preſumptuous Peace. For Peace of conſcience al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way ſuppoſes Peace with God, and this diſcove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by ſome overt act, elſe 'tis but a drunken Dream. If a Man have no teſtimony that God is reconciled to him, 'tis all one in effect, as if he were not reconciled.

If I can ſit down content under the diſhonour I have done, and the Provocation I have given unto my affectionate and tender hearted Father, I am an unworthy Child; nay if I ſo little and lightly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard his anger, as to be in no pain, but at eaſe under it, and ſo affront and undervalue his Love, as to be at reſt and content without it; I am a Rebel, not a Child, a Devil, not a Saint.

                  <pb n="287" facs="tcp:100687:155"/>and as reſpecting thoſe inward Qualifications, and Diſpoſitions, which if I do not know to be true and ſound, I can have no Evidence that God, or any Covenant Mercy is mine.

Reaſon</hi> the loweſt, the <hi>Handmaid,</hi> which muſt ſubmit and veil to the <hi>2d. Faith,</hi> the <hi>Chamberlain,</hi> of which is begotten the <hi>3d. Experience,</hi> the <hi>Treaſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer,</hi> the <hi>Heir of Faith,</hi> which hath the honour to abide, live and inherit when Faith ceaſes and dies, yet it is not poſthumous, but brought up under it, till it arrive at maturity in <hi>Paradiſe.</hi> When I ſpeak of Faith, I am not ſo fond as to poſtpone a credence to Divine Revelations in the Scriptures of the Old and New Teſtaments. I build all Chriſtian Faith upon that bottom ſolely, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſively to all Unwritten Traditions, or preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded Revelations which can never found a Divine Faith, of which alone I diſcourſe. Neither am I ſo ſtark drunk as to think that thoſe Scripture Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velations are not moſt highly rational, in the matter of them, as well as the motives to believe them; nor yet ſo frantick as to advance any Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periences unconform to Scripture. Let the <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinomians</hi> and <hi>Papiſts</hi> ſee to the firſt; the promo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of Reaſon in contradiſtinction (not to ſay contradiction) to Scripture, look to the ſecond; and <hi>Enthuſiaſts</hi> to the laſt. <hi>Experience</hi> with me is nothing but a ſenſible (yet rational) feeling of the performance of Promiſes, to a Man's ſelf in particular. When my inward ſenſe aſſures me, that the ſpiritual Covenant Mercies, are really beſtow'd upon me, and my outward Circumſtances demonſtrate that God owns me with the Tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral,
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:100687:157"/>I do not place theſe in Oppoſition but Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction, for without the inward Experiments, the outward ſignifie nothing. They may be and are <hi>Providential,</hi> but not <hi>Federal.</hi> Both are call'd <hi>Taſts of God's Goodneſs</hi> and <hi>Graciouſneſs,</hi> or of his <hi>Word, Pſal.</hi> 34.8. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.3. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119.103, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Now when an Experience of the performance of any Promiſe ſuperadds as it were a Seal to that Faith which receiv'd it as true, it gives a more full confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation to a Man's title to the Covenant, and all the Bleſſings and Comforts of it, and a further ground of quieting the Heart, and therefore is <hi>completive of Comfort, as Faith is inchoative.</hi> For if I do but weakly and doubtingly apprehend and apply the Comforts that are in God; yet when he beſtows upon me ſome ſpecial token of his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour, 'tis an emboldning, encouraging, pledge of his willingneſs to grant more, and a teſtimony of his owning my right to all. As in caſe of <hi>litigious Titles,</hi> when all ſtands upon the ſame bottom, if the Occupant freely yield up part to the Claimer, 'tis a vertual acknowledgement of his right to all, and therefore exceedingly animates him in his fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture proceedings for its recovery. Oh <hi>Divine Experience!</hi> the bleſſed earneſt of everlaſting Conſolation, how ſweet, how ſatisfying art thou? When a diſconſolate Heart is ſick of its own wants and woes, weary of it ſelf and the World as inſufficient to yield the leaſt drachm of ſolid Contentation, 'tis neceſſitated at laſt to ſend out <hi>Faith</hi> as a <hi>Harbinger</hi> to ſeek for <hi>Peace</hi> and <hi>Reſt,</hi> which it can no where find but in God, and no way deduce from God, but through thoſe free En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagements which his boundleſs Goodneſs has ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibited in the Covenant of Grace. Theſe Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings are as a <hi>Honey-comb</hi> in the promiſe, but <hi>Heaven</hi>
                  <pb n="291" facs="tcp:100687:157"/>in the performance. Indeed Heaven is no more nor leſs than the full and univerſal accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Promiſes; and that partial, incompleat fulfilling them in this Life, wherein conſiſts the happineſs of Experience, is no other than an Antepaſt or foretaſt of thoſe eternal Felicities which conſtitute that immortal ſtate.</p>
               <p>And now am I got to the foot of that Ladder whoſe top is Heaven. Comfort is the Off-ſpring of God, and thus deſcends to Man. The matter and ſubſtance of it, or the thing comforting, is originally ſomething of or from the Divine Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture it ſelf. Which when we had forfeited by Sin, the ever-bleſſed <hi>Jeſus, God's Eternal Son,</hi> did interpoſe to regain and purchaſe for us, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move all impediments to the conferring it on God's part. Whence he is call'd the <hi>Conſolation of Iſrael, Luk.</hi> 2.25. And our Conſolations are ſaid <hi>to abound by Chriſt,</hi> 2 Cor. 1.5. <hi>If there be any Conſolations in Chriſt,</hi> is the Hypotheſis of a very powerful Argument, <hi>Phil.</hi> 2.1. And that Prayer, 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 2.16, 17. is very conſiderable, <hi>Now our LORD Jeſus Chriſt himſelf, and GOD even our Father, who hath loved us, and given us everlaſting Conſolation through Grace: Comfort your Hearts, and eſtabliſh you in every good Word and Work.</hi> Hence the Father who is the principal Author, and Effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient hath obliged himſelf to beſtow it, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore is call'd <hi>the God of all Comfort,</hi> 2 Cor. 1.3. <hi>God that comforteth thoſe that are caſt down,</hi> 2 Cor. 7.6. See <hi>Iſa.</hi> 51.11, 12. <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 2.14. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 66.13. Eſpecially that remarkable place foremention'd <hi>Heb.</hi> 6.16, 17, 18. The <hi>Holy Ghoſt</hi> hath his part alſo, as removing the Impediments of Comfort on Man's part, preparing for it, and in the uſe of the means of Grace and Peace the Word and Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances,
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:100687:158"/>applying it actually to us; whence if our Tranſlation be of any Authority, he has the Name of <hi>Comforter</hi> given and appropriated to him, <hi>Joh.</hi> 14.16, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> I mention the Word and Ordinances of God, as the means of Comfort, and not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out warrant. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119.82. <hi>Mine Eyes fail for thy Word, ſaying when wilt thou Comfort me.</hi> Rom. 15.4. <hi>Whatever things were written aforetime, were written for our learning, that we through patience and comfort of the Scriptures might have hope.</hi> And to this purpoſe is it ſaid of the <hi>Comforter,</hi> Joh. 14.26. <hi>He ſhall teach you all things, and bring all things to your remembrance, whatſoever I have ſaid unto you.</hi> And <hi>Joh.</hi> 15.26. <hi>He ſhall teſtifie of me;</hi> all this in purſuance of his Office as <hi>Comforter.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now by theſe means
<list>
                     <item>1. He reveals Comfort to us in the Covenant and Promiſe.</item>

                     </item>
                     <item>4. Experience feels, with all other connex Graces, operating effectually in our Hearts. Wherefrom,</item>
                     <item>
                        <hi>Laſtly,</hi> A full Aſſurance ariſes, 1. That our Graces are ſound and ſincere, 2. That the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes are our Portion, the Lord our God, Chriſt our Saviour, the Holy Spirit our Sanctifier, Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, Joy, and Heaven our Inheritance, by ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Covenant-right, and from all theſe together neceſſarily grows <hi>actual Peace of Conſcience, and true ſpiritual Conſolation;</hi> but then 'tis only as far as we have the firſt <hi>Aſſurance,</hi> for without this we cannot aſſume to our ſelves any true Joy and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort;
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:100687:158"/>as far as the reſt iſſue in Aſſurance, but no farther, have we ſolace in and from them. Let there be as firm a Foundation laid, both without me, and within me, as is poſſible; yet if I know nothing of it, my Heart is uneaſie and unſettled, I am no better for it. But knowing that Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerity gives right to all in God; as ſoon as ever I attain true Faith of Evidence, all is compoſed into a quiet Settlement and Peace. And ſo certain is this, that even the falſe and fallacious Joys of both Hypocrites and prophane Perſons, muſt have an anſwerable perſwaſion in the Mind of a right to them. For no Man can take comfort in that which he knows he hath no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to do with. Indeed their Aſſurance is as groundleſs (though they do not know ſo much) as their Comfort is illuding and impoſtorous; and alway the nature of the Comfort doth perfectly anſwer the quality of the Aſſurance; if <hi>this</hi> be ſound and good, <hi>that</hi> is ſo alſo, if otherwiſe we gull our ſelves into real woe, under a deluſory dream of merely phantaſtical Conſolation.</item>
                  </list>
               </p>
               <p>Hence there's an abſolute neceſſity of abundance of Experience, and diligent trial, whether our Experience be conform to the Word of God; if we deſire that our Aſſurance may ſtand upon a ſecure baſis. For if we feel not the real effects of Divine Power and Goodneſs fulfilling to us in truth the Promiſe and Covenant of Grace, in writing the Divine Laws in our Hearts, and ena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling and exerciſing us to obſerve and obey them; we can have no Aſſurance, that any thing is right within us, or gives right to any thing without us. We muſt experience a ſound Work, that without fallacy may be aſcribed to God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf. For no Grace is true which is not of God's
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:100687:159"/>creating, to him doth the Scripture every where aſcribe it. One full place for all. <hi>Ezek.</hi> 36.26, 27. <hi>A new Heart alſo will I give you, and a new Spirit will I put within you, and I will take the ſtony Heart out of your Fleſh, and I will give you an Heart of Fleſh; and I will put my Spirit within you, and cauſe you to walk in my Statutes, and ye ſhall keep my Satutes and do them— Then ſhall ye remember your own evil ways, and your doings that were not good, and ſhall loath your ſelves in your own ſight, for your Iniquities, and for your Abominations,</hi> &amp;c. Firſt the Principle and Power muſt be confer'd by God, then and not till then the practice by Man will commence and begin, but all under the influence of Divine Grace. 'Tis firſt <hi>I will, I will,</hi> then <hi>you ſhall;</hi> and again to ſhow that the very <hi>[you ſhall]</hi> though Man's act, yet is not of and from Man, it follows, <hi>not for your ſake do I this, [do I]</hi> therefore not you without me, nor ſo by my aid neither, as that the doing it can more juſtly and truly be aſcribed to you than me, yet will not I do it without you, for ye ſhall loath your ſelves, <hi>i. e.</hi> by my Power; nor will I do it without your asking, for <hi>Ver.</hi> 37. <hi>Yet for this will I be enquired of by the Houſe of Iſrael, to do it for them.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>We muſt then have good experience, eſpecially of the Work of Divine Grace, in making the ſoundneſs of our <hi>Actings of Repentance</hi> and <hi>Faith</hi> ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent, and the fruits of both muſt concur to give a clear Teſtimony, that they are right and genuine, ſuch a full and thorow ſpiritual ſenſe and feeling muſt we have of them, and their agreeableneſs to the Rules and Laws of Scripture that require them; as to be able to ſatisfie our ſelves, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove our Conſciences to God, that we do not play the Hypocrites, and cheat our ſelves and the
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:100687:159"/>World with Counterfeits inſtead of unſophiſticate ſincere Graces, elſe we can never be bleſt with any certainty, that God is ours, and his Comforts ours, and therefore cannot groundedly take com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort in him. 'Tis then demonſtratively clear, that all the boundleſs Treaſures of Soul-ſatisfying Contents, which are laid up in <hi>God, Chriſt,</hi> the <hi>Holy Spirit, Heaven,</hi> the <hi>Covenant</hi> and <hi>Promiſes,</hi> are no actual Comfort to us, but only by the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diation of Grace within us; nor Grace it ſelf ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept its Integrity and Truth be evidenced plainly to us. So that in ſhort, all Comfort does imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately ſpring from Aſſurance. A Man hath ſo much Peace as he hath of this, and not a jot more. This is the neareſt matter and ground thereof, yet not abſolutely and in it ſelf conſidered merely but relatively to Grace, but neither Grace abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely, no, 'tis relatively to God, that it intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duces real Conſolation, <hi>viz.</hi> as an evidence that <hi>God is ours,</hi> and as it carries out our Souls to him, to place their whole Felicity in him. This there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore is the Genealogy or Pedigree of Comfort, 'tis the immediate Off-ſpring of Aſſurance, which is the Off-ſpring of Grace, which is the Off-ſpring of God. Aſſurance comforts, as it refers to Grace; Grace comforts as it leads to God; God comforts Architectonically, Originally, Eminent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, as the principal Efficient and Matter of all Legitimate Conſolation. Thus have I finiſhed all I conceive neceſſary to explain the Nature, Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin, Matter and Method of deriving Comfort into the Soul.</p>

                  <hi>My Doctrinal Inferences are Three.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. Hence ſee that it is a very lamentable thing for a Man to be left by God, to be worried by his own <hi>Thoughts.</hi> In what deplorable Circumſtances would <hi>David</hi> have been, had there been no Divine Comforts, to moderate and aſſwage the violence of his turbulent Cogitations? There's nothing in Man better or worſe than Thoughts. If a <hi>Good Angel</hi> act them, they are <hi>Birds</hi> of <hi>Paradiſe.</hi> They are the fureſt Guides, the ſweeteſt Companions, the ſoundeſt Comforts, the <hi>Firſt Movers</hi> in the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven of <hi>Vertue</hi> and <hi>Goodneſs,</hi> the <hi>laſt alive to God,</hi> the moſt delightful Anticipations of Everlaſting Bleſſedneſs, which realize thoſe <hi>Pleaſures</hi> and <hi>Joys,</hi>
                  <pb n="297" facs="tcp:100687:160"/>that are unutterable, the bright and fair <hi>Idea</hi> of the Inviſible Majeſty and Glory of God Himſelf. Contrarily, if acted by an Evil <hi>Genius,</hi> they are the very <hi>Beelzebub</hi> of the leſſer World, the <hi>Ignis Fatuus,</hi> that leads us into the Pits and Precipices of <hi>Errour, Wickedneſs, and Woe:</hi> They are the <hi>Locuſts and Smoak</hi> of the Bottomleſs Pit, that darken the Heavens of Peace and Contentation, devour and blaſt every living thing in us, the dreadful Image and Repreſentation of the black Horrours, and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſions of Hell. A Man is a Brute, a Fool, a Mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, or a Devil, as his Thoughts are; and his Thoughts will be as bad as Hell can make them, if Heaven do not ſuperviſe, govern, and direct them; and yet there needs no other Fiend to debauch them, than that Corruption that firſt enter'd in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to us by them, and does perpetually dog and haunt them. How many by them have been hur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried into <hi>Hoſpitals, Halters, Bridewel, Bedlam,</hi> and the diſmal Regions of eternal Darkneſs? How do they act all the Parts, appear in all the Forms, advance to all the degrees of Malignity and Miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry? But in none more than the <hi>Melancholick.</hi> Here Satan rides as in a triumphant Chariot, the Wheels are Thoughts, which by preſenting Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, and exciting Corruptions, he ſets a going, ſometimes with Conſent, ſometimes without. Hence proceed <hi>Atheiſtical, Blaſphemous,</hi> &amp;c. Inje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, which raviſh the Mind, in the greateſt ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horrence of the Will: Hence deſpairing Refle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, which realize and antedate thoſe intolera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Cruciations of outer Darkneſs; Hence terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying Motions, which deaden and betray the Aids and Supports of Reaſon and Religion, and finds a Devil in every Corner. Any one Thought, arm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by Juſtice, and acted by Satan, is ſufficient to
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:100687:161"/>embitter all the Joys of Life, and render a Man as miſerable, as is poſſible on this ſide, never ending Miſeries. Who then can bear up againſt a Multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude? <hi>Guarde me Dieu de moy,</hi> was my School-Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters Motto. No Man can have a greater finite Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my than his own Thoughts: A Multitude of theſe Tormentors within, is worſe, than all the rave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous <hi>Lions, and Bears, and Tigers, and Wolves,</hi> in the Univerſe; which by Power, or Induſtry, or Policy, Art, and Wit, a Man may avoid, but how ſhall he eſcape from himſelf; and that which is neareſt himſelf, his wild, mad, untutour'd, ungo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernable Cogitations? 'Twas then no improper Litany, <hi>From my ſelf, good God, guard and deliver me.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. See here, that the beſt of Men, may fall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to ſuch Perplexities, that all natural Aids may be inſufficient for their Relief. <hi>Not [my Carnal Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents, and the Pleaſures of Senſe]; not [my World<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Grandeur, and the Hopes, or Fruition of a King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom]; not [my Invincible Spirit, Valour, Conduct, Victories, and Military Glory]; not [my Rational Conſiderations, and Philoſophy,] but [thy Comforts]</hi> are the Sanctuary of his perſecuted, and perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting Thoughts: Here, and here alone, does he find repoſe and reſt. Indeed, if it were not thus, we could not be our ſelves. Did we enjoy all at home, we ſhould not be Men, but Gods. <hi>Self-ſufficiency</hi> is an incommunicable <hi>Perfection</hi> of the <hi>Deity.</hi> He that can be without all other Perſons and Things, is all. Sociableneſs is the Property and Felicity of Humane Nature; and therefore declares its Dependency. Man cannot be with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Man, much leſs without God. But if the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution of our Natures had been ſuch, that in all Exorbitances of Thoughts, we could readily com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:100687:161"/>our ſelves, into a ſerene and ſober Calm of Reſt: Such is our Native Pride and Self-fullneſs, ſince we were debaſed, and emptied of all good, by the Fall, that we ſhould never be induc'd to pay our due Tribute of Honour, and Homage un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to God, to which not ſo much Ingenuity leads us, as neceſſity drives us. 'Tis true, in the State of Integrity, Man was endowed with an Ability (not to recompoſe and redintegrate the Diſorders and Ruines in his Mind and Conſcience, introduced by irregular, peſtilent, and intemperate Cogitations, which ſuppoſe Loſs of Integrity, but) to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain in his Soul, a conſtant and durable Peace and Reſt; but then 'twas, becauſe he was poſſeſt of a Sufficiency of Wiſdom and Goodneſs to govern his Thoughts with that Balance, as to ſecure him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf from all their Inordinacies. But in laps'd Nature, the Caſe is otherwiſe: An unreſiſtible <hi>Impetus</hi> of Thoughts, is ſometimes inevitable; for there are two Principles in degenerate Man, of a contrary Genius, which poſſeſs his Principal Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties, <hi>Reaſon</hi> (but this much debilitated) in his Mind, <hi>Corruption</hi> (tho' not without ſome Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loy) in his Will. In all Moral Eſſays of <hi>Reaſon,</hi> 'tis very much thwarted by Corruption, and even in its Speculations infinitely weakned and debaſed. The Will poſſeſſes a kind of Empire over the Mind, to excite, divert, direct, or determine Thoughts, and vary all their Circumſtances, by propoſal of Objects, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and ſometimes to give a <hi>Superſedeas</hi> to ſome kind of Thoughts, though not all; but oft it raiſes up ſuch Spirits, as it cannot conjure down, and very ſeldom has Dominion o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the Matter or Subject of our Thoughts, to biaſs the Mind into ſuch Conceptions of Things, as it pleaſes, difform, and diſſonant, from the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:100687:162"/>of the Things themſelves, except where there is a more than ordinary Debauch, upon both Mind and Will. For the Reaſon of the <hi>Subject,</hi> muſt neceſſarily accord with the Reaſon of the <hi>Object,</hi> if there be any Truth in our Conceptions. Thoughts diſagreeing from Things, are Errours, and Deluſions. The Remainders therefore of Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption in the Will, after its Renewal by Grace, together with a ſubtile <hi>Tempter,</hi> and ſometimes the <hi>Holy Spirit of God</hi> himſelf (as under Convi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions of Sin) do excite ſuch Cogitations as are too hard for us, and bear down all the Supports of Nature, raiſing ſuch Tumults, and turbulent Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections, that our Spirits are ready to ſuccumb and ſink under them, into the moſt penſive Dum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſhneſs, Dolour, Deſpair, Horror, and Confuſion. He is a Stranger to Himſelf, the World, the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures, Chriſtianity, the Church, and particular Souls that know not this. If any will not yet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve it, I remit him to <hi>Bedlam,</hi> where his Senſe will convince him, what doleful Tragedies of this nature, have been, and are acted by <hi>Amorous, En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious, Studious, Dolorous,</hi> and <hi>Religious Melancholy,</hi> to omit other kinds. And what Man is there, that with any Senſe and Seriouſneſs, reflects upon his own particular Sins, againſt the <hi>Holy Majeſty of Heaven,</hi> in their odious Aggravations, toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with the declared Diſpleaſure and Indigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, the menaced Wrath and Curſe of Almighty Vengeance againſt them, and his Perſon for their ſake; but will ſometimes find ſo great and op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſive Perturbations in his Mind and Conſcience, as to be utterly at a <hi>Non-plus,</hi> and ſcarce able to ſecure himſelf from Deſpondency? Who is there, that in ſome, either common or uncommon Cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity, or imminent Danger thereof, does not ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:100687:162"/>find the Paſſions excited by his Thoughts, to be an Over-match for his Reaſon?

               <p>Now, no inward Affections are Self-movers, they neither do, nor can act, but upon the appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion of Sence, or Motion of Thoughts, or In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence of ſome exterior very powerful Agent, that can make immediate Impreſſions upon the Blood and Spirits, as neither are our Thoughts, (no, nor can be) any Moleſtation or Affliction, but only as irritating our Paſſions. And I would gladly ſee the Man, who by Rational or Religious Conſiderations, has reduc'd his Thoughts and Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions to that equable Temperament, and Balance, that they neither are nor can be induc'd or im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell'd, won, or wreſted into any Irregularity, or Exceſs, by the ſingle or united Powers of <hi>Earth, Hell,</hi> and <hi>Heaven;</hi> which laſt never depraves them, though it oft puniſhes us by them. Surely <hi>Job</hi> was a very good Man, yet the Extremity of his Afflictions provoked him to talk, and therefore think extravagantly. And if God Almighty caſt away the Reins out of his hands, and let looſe a Man's Thoughts upon him, (and who is there that gives him not a world of Provocation) I know not whither, even the moſt mere Man's Thoughts may not hurry him on this ſide Hell. If any deſire a full Conviction, what a wicked Man's

That ſo inconſiderable a Piece, as a Sinner, a Pourtrai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture of Hell, limn'd after the Image of Satan, (the Father of all Wickedneſs) an Enemy thro natural depravement, to God and Goodneſs, ſhould engage the Solicitude and Providence of Heaven, in ſuch admirable inſtances, to retrieve its loſt Happineſs, and recover it out of the Sink and A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byſs of Filth and Wretchedneſs, that it may be ſet aloft in the <hi>Galleries of Glory,</hi> and be beautified in, rather than beautifie, the Preſence-Chamber of the <hi>King</hi> of <hi>Kings:</hi> This, this is a wonder beyond the Dimenſion of all other Miracles, to be aſcrib'd to the Benignity and Efficiency of nothing Inferiour to Infiniteneſs.

               <p>Comfort! 'Tis a comprehenſive, an incompre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſible Bleſſing, like Him who <hi>Gives it,</hi> who <hi>Is</hi> it. All that God hath done, ſtill doth, and intends to do, is implied in it, or may be inferr'd from it. All the eternal good Purpoſes of the Divine Majeſty, for the Benefit of Man, the whole Undertaking and Purchaſe of His Well-beloved Son, every of the Gifts, Graces, and Workings of the <hi>Holy Spirit,</hi> are ſumm'd up here. For a Man is not capable of actual Comfort, till he enjoy Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurance, as hath been evinced, nor of aſſurance, till he be <hi>Juſtified</hi> and <hi>Sanctified;</hi> nor of theſe, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the <hi>Spirit of Grace,</hi> nor of that without the <hi>Mediation of Chriſt;</hi> nor is he capable of <hi>Eternal Comfort,</hi> till he enjoy all theſe in their Fulneſs. This one Mercy therefore is <hi>All;</hi> becauſe where <hi>It</hi> is given, <hi>All</hi> are given before or with it, and it is given as the Fruit of <hi>All;</hi> the Beſtowal of it, being the conſummate Act of Divine Munificence. In Summ, Comfort in part, is part of Heaven; per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect Comfort, is perfect Heaven. Oh aſtoniſhing Grace! Oh unimitable <hi>Goodneſs</hi> in the Donor! Oh unlimitable Bleſſedneſs in the Poſſeſſor! <hi>Oh what is man, Lord, that thou art thus mindful of him, or the ſon of man, that thou doſt thus viſit him!</hi> Erect thy ſelf, Oh my Soul, into an admiring Contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plation,

               </p>
               <p>'Tis not poſſible that a Man's Conſcience ſhould be truly comforted, except he know that Comfort
<pb n="307" facs="tcp:100687:165"/>appertains to him, is his right. For though the Contemplation of Golden Mountains may gratifie the Imagination of a Fool, yet no wiſe Man counts himſelf richer for a dream of the <hi>Spaniſh Silver Mines</hi> in <hi>Potoſi, &amp;c.</hi> or the <hi>Golden Tagus,</hi> or <hi>Rio de Plata.</hi> That <hi>Athenian</hi> is upon Record for no <hi>Philoſopher,</hi> who ſolac'd himſelf with a conceit that all the Ships arriving at the Port were his own. Sound Peace of Mind is always founded upon good Evidence of an undoubted Right to Peace. For if I doubt that I deceive mine own Soul, in ſpeaking <hi>Peace</hi> to my ſelf, <hi>where there is no Peace;</hi> that very dubiouſneſs will rack and torture me, as much as (poſſibly more than) I ſhould have been, bad I never claim'd Peace; ſince an uſurpation of what I have no title to, is a new ſin ſuperadded to the old ſore of <hi>Soul-diſquieters,</hi> and the very fear that I am guilty of it hath Torment. Now I cannot poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly be aſſur'd that Comfort belongs to me of right, unleſs I find within my ſelf the diſpoſitions that qualifie for Comfort; that is, except I be conſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lable, I cannot be comforted. If I be not agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to Comfort, it is not agreeable to me. For the right to Comfort is not Abſolute but Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional. 'Tis not Nature that entitles to it but Grace; therefore in all the Epiſtolary Salutati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, 'tis firſt <hi>Grace,</hi> then <hi>Peace.</hi> Whence a Man can be no more aſſured that he hath right to Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, than he is aſſured he hath true Grace. And Experience demonſtrates, that a Perſon, if he underſtand himſelf, to be abſolutely inconſola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, who cannot be ſatisfied, that he hath really performed the Conditions of the Covenant of Grace, as far as is neceſſary to found a preſent right to the Bleſſings of that Covenant. Doubt
<pb n="308" facs="tcp:100687:166"/>of this, and doubt of all. I muſt have good and ſound Evidence of this, or I build upon Sand. Imaginary Grace will only introduce imaginary Right, therefore none but an imaginary Peace. The Superſtructure can be no more firm and ſtable than the Foundation. Whence it being im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible to be really Comforted, without a ſound perſwaſion of Right, and impoſſible to be certain of right without certainty of the truth of Grace, it follows that Comfort is not poſſible without Aſſurance. Therefore not rational. 'Tis a very imprudent part in a Man to <hi>ſpeak Peace to himſelf,</hi> when God does proclaim open War; abſolute madneſs to arreſt Divine Conſolations, when it is Indiſpenſible Duty, to apply and meditate Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror, to bleſs himſelf with appropriating Promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, when his Condition is palpably under the Threatning, and he either knows it or has juſt reaſon to ſuſpect it. There's no middle ſtate be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween Sanctified and Unſanctified, Pardoned and Unpardoned. If a Man know that he is Unjuſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, yet aſſume to himſelf the Comfort of the Promiſes, he preſumes ſenſleſsly and ſottiſhly to give the lye to <hi>God.</hi> Let ſuch read and conſider <hi>Deut.</hi> 29.18, 19, 20, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> If any doubt of his Pardon, yet ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply Comfort, he gives his Conſcience the <hi>go-by,</hi> and makes fair weather in deſpite of <hi>Heaven.</hi> In ſhort, Peace of Conſcience cannot poſſibly ariſe from any other ſcource, than <hi>Conſcience of a State Frame and Way acceptable to God.</hi> If I have no motives to conciliate a Credibility to this, and yet will ſolace my ſelf, and caſt off all trouble, care and fear, huſh the ſtorm within, compoſe the rouling Waves, and ſettle; 'tis but upon the Lees, the Mire and Dirt, and too much a Token and Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony
<pb n="309" facs="tcp:100687:166"/>of Madneſs, Drunkenneſs or Searedneſs of Conſcience.</p>
               <p>The 2d. Part of the Conviction concerns <hi>Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,</hi> which 'tis as neceſſary to eſtabliſh as the Mind. Truth and Sincerity in the Heart being as momentous and conſiderable as Truth in the Head or Underſtanding.</p>
               <p>Humane (nay all ſublunary) Nature is fond of Eaſe and Reſt, and entertains all Perturbations with reluctancy and dolour; but above all trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of Mind and Conſcience is moſt uneaſie, Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort and Peace moſt natural, agreeable, and grate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful. <hi>Prov.</hi> 18.14. and 17.22. and 12.25. and 15.13. Hence every one would and will, (if it be poſſible) live in ſome kind of Peace. But 'tis the unhappineſs of the Generality through igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, inconſideration and greedineſs of Reſt, to ſnatch at the mere ſhadow, and ſo that they may but be free from Pain, and the dreadful Convulſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and Cramps of Conſcience, matter not whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it be through Sleep, Numbneſs, Stupefaction, or Death. But this is not to be accounted Peace, any more than a Swoon is Reſt. 'Tis really a Diſeaſe the <hi>Lethargy of Conſcience;</hi> out of which when it awakes in this or another World, 'tis tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tured with the crueleſt Pangs, ſtung and rack'd with the moſt direful Anguiſh and Agonies ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginable. It therefore is of no little conſequence to know, whether our Comfort be genuine, that we dream not our ſelves into deeper Woes, in the embraces of falſe and fallacious Joys. Let our Conſciences therefore ſee to it that they be not put off with Phantaſms and Illuſions, inſtead of ſolid Conſolations. Seeing then there is a World of adulterine cozening Peace, what may be the

An impenitent Sinner is at quiet in his Mind, either becauſe he never knew the deplorable Wretchedneſs and Wickedneſs of his Natural State, or never would know it, or becauſe knowing it and being frigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted therewith, he takes a ſiniſter method to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jure down the ſenſe and terror of it; either mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering Convictions by diverting his Thoughts, Cares, Courſe and Conduct, as the Prophane; or ſtopping the Mouth of Conſcience by entering into the <hi>road of Religion,</hi> as do the <hi>Hypocrites,</hi> when yet there's ſomething that paſſes Judgment underneath, and whiſpers to them that all is not right, and juſtifiable before God, whatever their ſhows may be before Men. Or if through blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Mind or Self-flattery they have arriv'd to that depth of Deluſion, as to deceive their own Souls, and being accuſtomed to collogue with God, are left by him to believe a lye, (as 'tis juſt for thoſe that mock God with ſhadows, to be permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to feed thereon themſelves, and to be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed upon by that whereby they attempt to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe upon their Maker) they live in a Calm, and die in a Miſt, not knowing where they are till they feel themſelves in Hell.</p>

               <p> But theſe are perverſe, prepoſterous Methods to Peace, which will iſſue in a more deſtructive War and Confuſion. True Comfort grows out of, and in the midſt of Thoughts, <hi>multitude of Thoughts, which affect the Heart with godly Sorrow:</hi> Such I ſcruple not to call that of the <hi>Pſalmiſt</hi>'s, which the Context exhibits, and the Text im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies under the notion of <hi>Branchings,</hi> here ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred <hi>Thoughts,</hi> but which no leſs includes the <hi>Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections,</hi> and every thing which iſſues from the Soul as the Bough from the Tree; beſide that his Trouble, and therefore <hi>Grief,</hi> did main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly reſpect the publick Intereſt of the <hi>Church, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion</hi> and <hi>God.</hi> This was the Harbinger of his Joy. And that Comfort is of this Lineage, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears by many Scriptures, as <hi>Pſal.</hi> 112.4. <hi>

See alſo <hi>Iſa.</hi> 57.18. and 61.2, 3. <hi>Matth.</hi> 5.4. If there be not firſt trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled Thoughts, Comfort will neither be ſought, given nor valu'd. The moſt take no thought a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout their Condition and Comfort, yet are at eaſe, becauſe they never engage their thinking Powers; ſo the ſenſeleſs, careleſs, wicked ones; the reſt of Men who ſleep in the ſoft Bed of patch'd formal Religion, and dream themſelves into carnal Security, (as the Phariſaical) never think thorowly. Their Thoughts are a lively Emblem of their Devotions, or theſe of them; all ſuperficial, nothing ſolid and to good purpoſe.</p>
               <p>A Man is only that in Religion, which his Thoughts are. Home Thoughts, that go to the bottom of things, and repreſent them as they
<pb n="312" facs="tcp:100687:168"/>are, and go to the bottom of the Heart, and touch it to the quick; make a Man ſound and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious in Soul concerns.

                  </gap>. Such Thoughts may poſſibly lick and ſleek over the Affections, and give them a Face, but cannot give them Life; and where our Sorrows are not a living Spring, they will never iſſue in other than dead Contents and Joys. Thoſe Thoughts that never warm and melt the Heart, do but terminate in cold Comfort. If they do not mould, and faſhion, and frame our Souls aright, as the Potter does his Clay, we ſhall never be Veſſels of Honour to be repleniſhed with divine Conſolations.</p>
               <p>Oh then, my Soul, where are thy piercing heart-wounding Reflections? Will the All-wiſe God be ſo profuſe of his medicinal healing Balms, as to apply them waſt where there are no Sores? Can the all-knowing Phyſician of Souls be ſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſcreet, as prodigally to conſume and ſpend his reviving Cordials, where neither <hi>the Head is ſick, nor the Heart faint?</hi> Do no mollifying Conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions diſtil down as the dew upon the Reck be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neath, to ſupple it into a repenting tenderneſs? Doſt thou never aſcend in thy Meditations to the third Heaven, and take a deliberate view of thoſe yerning Bowels of Commiſeration which did com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſs thee about, when in thy Blood, with the reſt of Mankind, devoted to everlaſting Deſtruction, upon account of thy violation (in <hi>Adam</hi>) of the <hi>Covenant of Nature?</hi> Does not God's Eternal Love, which was its own motive to eſtabliſh that Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven and Earth-aſtoniſhing Occonomy of Grace, for

Art thou harden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed againſt the powerful impreſſions of that admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Grace? Behold then further in <hi>Golgotha,</hi> a ſpectacle that would regele and diſſolve even Eyes of Flint, and intenerate a Heart all Rock of <hi>Adamant.</hi> Oh behold thy panting, groaning, bleeding, dying, Redeemer, the ever-bleſſed Son of God, breathing out his oppreſſed Soul, under the burthen of thy Curſe, to procure for thee an Inheritance of everlaſting Bleſſedneſs. This, O this is a melting ſight indeed. Did the very Rocks relent, and rent aſunder, the palſied Earth deveſt its obſtinate natural ſtableneſs, and as if there had been a luxation of all its Ligaments, compoſe it ſelf into a tremulous Palpitation; and the very face of Nature it ſelf put on Sack-cloath, gather Blackneſs, enwrap it ſelf in a Mourning dreſs, and envelop all its Glories in a noonday night, upon that fatal Eclipſe of the Glory of both the viſible and inviſible World, <hi>the Sun of Righteouſneſs,</hi> that the <hi>Philoſopher</hi> did not without good reaſon infer, upon the Contemplation there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, that it imported either <hi>the God of Natures Paſſion, or its verging towards a Diſſolution?</hi> And ſhall that which overcomes all the repugnances of Nature, find and leave thee a piece of the nether Milſtone, with a pervicacious ſtubbornneſs hardening thy ſelf againſt Sorrow? In a compaſſionate regard of thy wretchedneſs, he did then by ſtrength of Love how the Heavens,<note place="margin">

<pb n="315" facs="tcp:100687:169"/>ready method, to be unutterably miſerable, till the lamentable experience and feeling of the one eternally, do utterly extinguiſh all hopes of the other, except Almighty Power, to introduce <hi>Repentance,</hi> create ſuch bitter and ſenſible fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taſts, that with <hi>Heman, Pſal.</hi> 88.15.

               <p>Did thy thoughts, Oh my Soul, never affect thee with theſe and the like things, as the greateſt Realities, matters of Senſe not of mere Specula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion? Haſt thou never been ſick and ſore through the plague of thine Heart? Art thou whole without a Phyſician? Haſt thou never a Spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Wound, or want, to force and drive thee out of thy ſelf? Seeſt thou never a divine lovely Perfection, a ſuitable attractive Excellency in Chriſt to draw thee? In ſhort, haſt thou never entertain'd any feeling Conſiderations of the true way to Comfort? Never ſtudied that courſe and procedure of Divine Goodneſs, whereby he leads to it? Never entred in at the <hi>ſtrait Gate of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance,</hi> which alone admits into the Manſion of thoſe unfading Joys? Haſt thou never got thy native Blindneſs of Mind, in ſome good degree heal'd by the Spiritual Eye-ſalve of Heaven?

<pb n="316" facs="tcp:100687:170"/>thoughts be deep and powerful, and have thy Heart at command: If thou weigh and conſider with all ſeriouſneſs and deliberation the neceſſity of being qualified aright for Peace, and the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of preſuming thy Conſcience into a calm ceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation, under a ſtate of Enmity to God; that for thy life thou dareſt not entertain a jot of Comfort, further than thy Light, Spirit, and Condition can be fully reconciled to it, and free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly admit it, upon a full and thorow pondering all Circumſtances, and examining thy Heart, ſearching thy Conſcience to the bottom; becauſe as much affraid of being abuſed by <hi>Satan,</hi> and Self-flattery into a falſe Peace, as ambitious of, and in love with a true: If thou reflect upon thoſe Sorrows which are introductory to Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Joys, to enquire whether they be of the right Model, what Image and Superſcription of God there is upon them, and with infinite care and endeavour ſtrive to rectifie whatever is amiſs therein, whether reſpecting their Object, Motive, or End, that thou mayſt not take the left Hand way, but the right, by weeping Croſs to Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, ſtill renewing thy Griefs for their own fai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lures, till the real Effects demonſtrate them to be indeed <hi>according to God:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.9, 10, 11.</note> If thou canſt not be ſatisfied till Sin, as Sin, an offence againſt God, truly break thy very Heart, and work it into an ingenuous tenderneſs, that the warm Boſom of everlaſting Love thaw thy frozen Affections, and with its ſweet and gentle Impulſe and Influence, melt the flinty Rock within, and pour it down in Peniten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial Showrs, that not mere Self-love, which en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gages Grief in a fear of Wrath, and deſire of Indemnity; nor mere Natural Conſcience, acting
<pb n="317" facs="tcp:100687:170"/>upon Rational Principles without reſpect to God, may draw out thy Sorrows; but thy diſingenu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, unworthy, baſe carriage, to ſo kind, tender, affectionate, every way amiable and obliging a Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, may diſſolve thee into repentant Groans and Dolours; if thou take as much pains, that thy Penitence may be ſincere, as thou cheriſheſt deſire, that thy Peace may be ſweet, and ſure, and under the conduct of this endeavour feel any Revivings; theſe are the Comforts of God.</p>
               <p n="2">2. True and falſe Comforts differ in their At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendants, or Company.

                  </note> Contrarily falſe Joys are at Peace with Sin, and have little or no reſpect for God or Holineſs: How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever there's nothing cordial there, all's but pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence and Phantaſtry. A ſetled courſe of Sin; Love to any one Omiſſion or Commiſſion; Servi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude to Sin, are utterly inconſiſtent with the <hi>Peace of God, which paſſeth all underſtanding.</hi> For this <hi>keeps watchfully both Mind and Heart, as with a guard and Garriſon,</hi> Phil. 4.7. Therefore true Peace always lives in a ſtate of War; there's an Enemy in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect, What need of a Guard where no danger? The Foes that immediately aſſault the <hi>Mind and Heart,</hi> are <hi>Error and Sin;</hi> theſe are the <hi>Sting the Strength of the old Dragon,</hi> who can harm us by no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe; theſe batter down our Defences, make breaches in our Walls, bury our Peace in Rubbiſh and Ruins: Which therefore only lives, when it
<pb n="318" facs="tcp:100687:171"/>fortifies and ſecures againſt theſe; but if they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail it certainly and inevitably dies, and is inca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of a Reſurrection, till Sovereign Grace re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>new us to <hi>Repentance;</hi> beating down our Corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and reviving our decayed Graces, that we begin with new Life and livelineſs, to ſtrive a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Evil, and to do good; which the Scripture enjoyns under the Metaphor of entring into, and in at the little preſſed, narrow, or ſtrait way and Gate.</p>
               <p>God will not loſe this precious Seed of Peace, by ſowing it among Weeds or Thorns, or Rocks, or common Roads: A good and honeſt Heart on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly receives it, keeps it, and is kept by it. He that hath really felt the bitterneſs of enmity with God, as every one muſt ere he be ſolac'd with a ſenſe of his Love; cannot eaſily be reconciled to his own woe, or return to the ſilthy Vomit that brings it. For War with Heaven is Hell; where pure unmixed Juſtice acts againſt Sinners, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the demerit of their Sins, and without In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termiſſion or Mitigation; and Sinners act againſt God, with the full and unreſtrained bent for their Wills, without regret or rebuke of Conſcience, for the Sins there committed; though under the deepeſt Agonies, and moſt diſmal Remordencies of Conſcience for the Sins committed here. And if the higheſt degree of this Enmity be the loweſt Abyſs of Miſery, all inferiour degrees muſt neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarily in the ſame proportion, partake of the ſame Nature, and retain as much of the latter, as they do of the former; and an Ounce of Mercury is Poyſon as well as a Pound. I know there are <hi>Mountebanks</hi> in Religion, that dare adventure to drink down a Toad, in confidence of an <hi>Orvietan</hi> or <hi>Antidote;</hi> but that had need be ſure (which yet
<pb n="319" facs="tcp:100687:171"/>is impoſſible) that this Preſervative be not in the Power of an Enemy, who hath liberty and autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity to withhold it at pleaſure, even in their ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremeſt Neceſſity, elſe they certainly ſwallow their own (as to themſelves) remedileſs Damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. If Men take the boldneſs to ſin upon pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption, that Repentance and the Merit of Chriſt will ſecure them; who yet may be fully aſſured, that both are ſolely the gift of God, whom by their confident and daring impudence herein, they infinitely diſoblige and irritate; they for a while after this ſweet Figg, may enjoy the content of a little rotting eaſe, but the Poyſon is ſecretly inſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuating it ſelf into their Vitals, and corrupting them with ſo malignant a Contagion, as renders their Diſeaſe the more incurable, and their eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Perdition inevitable. He that is in love with ſuch Comfort as this, may take it, much good may it do him, if it can; but I fear he will never have Joy of it in another World.</p>
               <p>We dread that which hath once burnt us. Ask a wounded Spirit, what eaſe there is in rebelling againſt Heaven, and what Satisfaction it can hope for in that ſtate of War, and how in its preſent circumſtances it can reliſh all thoſe ſenſual Joys, where-from it once receiv'd ſo much ſeeming Contentation? Oh now, they are Wormwood and Gall, and create in Reflection as much anguiſh and torment, as ever they did comfort in Fruiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. The <hi>Honey</hi> is gone, the <hi>Sting</hi> remains; the Pleaſure is vaniſh'd,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.21.</note> the Pain emerges, and will endure till a thorow Peni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence, and unfeigned Faith, introduce a ſenſe of Reconciliation with God, that it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes as clear and evident, that the Enmity in our minds againſt God, and God's Enmity againſt
<pb n="320" facs="tcp:100687:172"/>us is aboliſhed, as before it was plain, that there had been no good underſtanding betwixt us. For, how can an enlightned Conſcience be quiet till it be ſatisfied, that it ſtands upon good terms with its <hi>Sovereign Lord?</hi> If its fears build upon the old bottom, <hi>viz.</hi> a perſwaſion that omnipotent Wrath is arming againſt it; how can it be at reſt? To be patient under this, much more to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, moſt of all to be pleaſed and Jovial, is bru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſh ſtupidity and ſenſeleſneſs, or deſperate fool<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hardineſs and madneſs; which can iſſue in nothing but the everlaſting torturous Senſe, and Plagues of Hell, if boundleſs Mercy prevent not, by a ſound awakening, and Converſion. There can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not then be any Divine Comfort, if there be not a ſweet Compoſure and Harmony betwixt Earth and Heaven; and this can never be where a Man is at peace with his Sins: Therefore whatever quiet may ſeem to be in ſuch a Soul, 'tis only per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonated and illuſive; it reaches not to the real bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom of the trouble, takes not out the Core.</p>
               <p>But on the other hand, when a Man makes Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, and Mortification, Faith, and a good Life the main employ, which drinks up his Spirits, and Strength, and Time; induſtriouſly contend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, in all things to approve the ſincerity and heartineſs of his Affections, Deſigns, and Aims, and whole Deportment in the ſight of God; and whilſt he is thus doing, finds any quietude Reſt and Satisfaction of Mind to ſweeten his Work, and ſettle his Conſcience; he may be confident that this is the true Comfort of the <hi>Holy Ghoſt.</hi> For as 'tis impoſſible to enjoy true Peace under reigning Sin, ſo tis inconſiſtent with <hi>Divine Goodneſs, and Fede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Love</hi> to permit a true Heart, intirely devoted to him, to delude it ſelf into true Miſeries, under
<pb n="321" facs="tcp:100687:172"/>the vizor of falſe Joys. I confeſs, if a Man be too greedy of Comfort, and too haſty in his Applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, without due conſideration, and indeavour, and care to derive his Satisfactions from ſolid Grounds, laying the ſtreſs upon things which will not bear it; in ſuch indeliberate precipitation of Judgment, concerning a Mans ſtate, and the true root of Comfort, when he founds it upon any thing leſs than ſubſtantial <hi>Piety, Righteouſneſs</hi> and <hi>Sobriety,</hi> as the evidence of his Right; he may ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uſe himſelf with an unſound, unſolid Peace. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I always ſuppoſe that the procedure, in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to Comfort be juſtifiable, and the Grounds upon which a Man bottoms his Evidence be genu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ine, and that his reaſon and judgment lead him leiſurely in the Scripture way, to Heart-eaſe and Reſt; elſe all may iſſue in greater inquietude and trouble, whatever fair Weather may at preſent flatter his conſcience. But if Spiritual ſenſe, light and a ſerious Preponderation of all circumſtances, according to the preceeding particular, direct our motions hither, and true Religiouſneſs con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm them; we may be ſecure, that mere Shows and Pageantry do not now delude us into a Fairy Paradiſe. A weak Head, 'tis true, may lead an honeſt Heart into a deceitful Peace. And 'tis not the deſign of Grace to aboliſh or reform the natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Depravations and Deformities of our Faculties ſo much as the Moral: But that which is defective muſt not be made a <hi>Standard.</hi> A good Soul that underſtands it ſelf and obſerves ſolid Rules, in comforting it ſelf, cannot be deceiv'd in that Peace which it poſſeſſes, whilſt it loves God and keeps his way. Such as a Mans goodneſs is, will his Conſolation be. If that be but External and Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocritical, this will be inſincere and deluſory; but
<pb n="322" facs="tcp:100687:173"/>a true intelligent, honeſt Heart, proceeding with a juſt caution, ſhall never be gull'd with a <hi>Mock-Peace.</hi> For, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 97.11, 12. <hi>Light is ſown for the Righteous, and gladneſs for the upright in heart. Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce in the Lord, ye Righteous.</hi> What God ſows, they ſhall reap. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 85.8, 10. <hi>I will hear what God the Lord will ſpeak, for he will ſpeak peace unto his people, and to his Saints,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Mercy and Truth have met together, Righteouſneſs and Peace have kiſſed each other.</hi> Their embrace is ſtrict and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſſoluble; God hath eſpouſed them, they cannot be divorced. <hi>What he hath joyned together, none ſhall finally ſeparate and part aſunder.</hi> They give mutual teſtimony each to others integrity and ſoundneſs. <hi>In Life they are lovely, in Death they cannot be divided, but will cohabit eternally.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Where then, Oh my Soul, is thy <hi>Righteouſneſs,</hi> not particular meerly, but univerſal? <hi>Shew me thy comfort by thy Works, for 'tis dead being alone. As the Body without the Spirit is dead, ſo is Peace without Holineſs,</hi> which is its very Life and Soul. If thou be not <hi>God-like,</hi> thy Joys are not <hi>Heaven-like.</hi> All true pleaſures are drops of thoſe <hi>Rivers at God's Right Hand,</hi> Pſal. 36.8. and 46.4. and 16. ult. If the <hi>Waters of Life</hi> have never quickned and cleanſed thee, thoſe Streams of Divine Comfort never yet did refreſh thee; thou haſt only drunk of the <hi>Abana</hi> and <hi>Pharphar</hi> of muddy, carnal Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentments, not of the pure Fountain of Celeſtial Conſolations. Wherein then can thy upright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and real honeſty of heart approve it ſelf to God? <hi>Is this thy rejoycing,</hi> 2 Cor. 1.12. <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>Teſtimony of thy conſcience, that in ſimplicity and god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſincerity, not with fleſhly Wiſdom, but by the grace of God, thou haſt had thy Converſation in the World.</hi> What haſt thou to ſhew more than an Hypocrite?
<pb n="323" facs="tcp:100687:173"/>Wherein does thy <hi>Righteouſneſs</hi> excel that of <hi>Scribes</hi> and <hi>Phariſees?</hi> What are thy Principles, Motives, manner of acting, Aims and Ends, in thy whole courſe of Life? Do'ſt thou really act, 1. From God, a Spirit of new Life, breathed into thee by God. 2. Through Chriſt, as the Foundation of thy hopes of acceptance. 3. By the Spirit, as thy immediate aid in every Holy performance. 4. Unto God, as thy ultimate end. Haſt thou no ſecret reſerved <hi>Dalilahs?</hi> No one thing in which thou would'ſt have liberty, and preſume upon Pardon: Do'ſt thou not run upon a biaſs in Religion, and twine aſide in ſome ſiniſter reſpect to ſelf, or the popular Vogue, in which thou would'ſt be ſomebody? Is it thy great and upper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt care and ſtudy to be true to him that ſees in ſecret, rather than applauded by thoſe who only ſee the <hi>Outſide;</hi> that thy inward gracious <hi>Diſpoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi> may go no leſs than thy outward <hi>Semblances?</hi> Art thou above all things jealous of thy deceitful Heart, afraid of <hi>Hypocriſie;</hi> willing to do any thing that may tend to a full diſcovery of thy ſelf, to thy ſelf?

And do'ſt thou expect thy peace in no other way? Haſt thou been induſtriouſly and labouriouſly diligent, to gain a true and thorow

What Conditions and Qualifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions are prerequiſite to diſpoſe thee for Comfort, and to be clear, that in reality they are in thee, and that thou do'ſt not build thy Evidence hereof upon ſelf-flattering, deceitful Grounds, but do'ſt in truth find, that the intereſt of God is Soveraign and Supreme in, and neareſt thy Heart, hath the univerſal Regiment and command over all, being thy ſingular delight; and whatever thou feel'ſt to oppoſe, becomes on that account an intolerable burthen, thy daily lamentation? Thou dareſt not aſſume to thy ſelf any comfort, nor be at reſt in thy Spirit, till thou beeſt in ſome good degree ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, that <hi>God and goodneſs</hi> have (as far as Humane Infirmity, and this preſent ſtate will permit) the <hi>all of thy Heart, Mind, Soul and Strength,</hi> or thy moſt earneſt, preſſing, active, induſtrious, perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering deſires hereof; which not to feel is a grief and torment inſupportable, and drives thee to new exerciſes of <hi>Repentance and Faith in Chriſt</hi> for <hi>Pardon</hi> and Aid, that thy ſecond endeavours may be more upright, thy after thoughts more effica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious: And do'ſt thou ſeek and find eaſe and reſt for thy ſelf in no other method, than <hi>looking and coming to Jeſus, with a weary, labouring, heavy-laden Heart,</hi> entirely devoted to him, and therefore ſincerely willing and deſirous to <hi>learn of him meek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and lowlineſs of Heart, and to take his Yoak upon thee, which is eaſie, and his Burthen which is light,</hi> Matt. 11.29, 30.

'Tis no leſs true in a Spiritual ſenſe, than a Natural. If <hi>My God</hi> in natural Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, argue the Life of Nature: My God in fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deral Relation does as ſtrongly infer the Life of Grace. For 'tis not any where affirmed of <hi>Cain, Eſau, Judas,</hi> &amp;c. after their Death, that God was then their God, as of <hi>Abraham,</hi> &amp;c. al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though they be no leſs alive in Soul; the Immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality whereof is a common Privilege, and admits of no degrees in one more than other. <hi>My God</hi> then to <hi>Abraham,</hi> &amp;c. is another thing, and to
<pb n="326" facs="tcp:100687:175"/>be taken in another ſenſe, than that wherein it may be applicable to <hi>Cain,</hi> &amp;c. ſince 'tis uſed of the godly after Death, in an appropriate incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municable ſenſe. It may truly be apply'd to the very Devils and damned in any ſenſe, not import<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Moral, Spiritual Life of <hi>Purity and Peace;</hi> but in this 'tis the ſole Prerogative of the godly, that are <hi>born again, not of Blood, nor of the Will of the Fleſh, nor of the Will of Man, but of God,</hi> Joh. 1.13. When therefore our <hi>Pſalmiſt</hi> owns the <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Majeſty,</hi> under the Relation of <hi>My God,</hi> the meaning is, <hi>Mine</hi> to whom I am confederated, u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nited as a principle of new Divine Spiritual Life, as the Soul of my Soul, in whoſe <hi>all</hi> I have a true <hi>federal Right,</hi> in his Being, his Perfections, his <hi>Knowledge, Coodneſs, Love, Life, Peace,</hi> &amp;c. whoſe Comforts therefore benignly eye me, and invite my acceptance, becauſe I, and all mine are his, <hi>He himſelf, and all his</hi> through (not Creation merely, but) the <hi>Covenant of Grace,</hi> are mine; I therefore poſſeſs living Comforts, becauſe I enjoy a living God as mine own, by <hi>Vital <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Indeed, Spiritual Joys only affect Spiritual liv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Souls. Cordials are never adminiſtred to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>animated Carkaſes, nor Divine Comforts to the Dead in Sins and Treſpaſſes. Firſt Reſurrection, then Aſcenſion into a Heaven of Reſt. Natural, Animal Life inherits no Spiritual Peace,<note place="margin">1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.44, 50, 51.</note> any more than a natural Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, Celeſtial Pleaſures. <hi>All muſt be changed</hi> ere they can be tranſlated into this Paradiſe. As the corruptible part of us is aboliſhed at the Reſurrection of the Body, elſe we cannot <hi>enter into Life:</hi> So the corrupting part muſt be Crucified at the Reſurrection of our Souls, or we <hi>cannot enter into Peace.</hi> Iſa. 57.2.

               <p>That of <hi>Solomon,</hi> Eccleſ. 2.2. is every way ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified of the wicked. <hi>I ſaid, of laughter it is mad, and of mirth, what doth it?</hi> For what greater fren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zy, than to laugh in the face of incenſed condemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Juſtice.

And what kind of things, of what Vertue and Efficacy are the ſavoury Cogitations that iſſue from theſe
<pb n="330" facs="tcp:100687:177"/>mindings? When thou ſettleſt theſe Workings of Soul upon the Fleſh and the World, thou makeſt them thy gods, as the carnal heart does. Truly nothing deſerves, or can be worthy of this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention of Mind, but what is Spiritual and Celeſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al. Wherever this is engaged, from thence is thy Life, and thy Peace is Congenerous to thy Life. If the beſt things habitually and ſtatedly enjoy theſe endeavours and motions of thy ſuperiour Powers, and maintain an inviolable Authority o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver them; thy Life is the beſt, and no other thy Conſolations.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Laſtly,</hi> real and deceiving Comforts may be dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferenced by their tendency and effects. They both end as they begin. The cheating Peace of the <hi>Prophane and Hypocritical,</hi> will never produce any conſcionable perſevering cares, and endeavours, to pleaſe God and profit Men. But, <hi>the joy of the Lord, is the Souls ſtrength</hi> in his ſervice, and ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more leads to him in Holineſs of Heart and Life; and to more lively actings of <hi>Faith, Love,</hi> and <hi>Gratitude,</hi> to growth in <hi>Grace</hi> and <hi>Godlineſs;</hi> as is not obſcurely intimated in the example of the <hi>Pſalmiſt.</hi> We will ſuppoſe the actings of his Grace to proceed in the ſame tenor, with the Expreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons thereof in the <hi>Pſalm.</hi> For we have no other Evidence thereof, and may Rationally judge this to be a Report of his inward <hi>Senſations,</hi> in their Nature, Order, Progreſs, and Perfection, as we find in other <hi>Pſalms.</hi> Well, his Faith, which at the beginning appears ſomething pendulous, weak, and wavering as to that particular thing, about which it was firſt engaged, <hi>viz.</hi> the Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſal of Divine Juſtice, to ſecure the Church from the rage of its Enemies, and could only look for this in a Petitionary way, and view it in its cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,
<pb n="331" facs="tcp:100687:177"/>Verſ. 1, 2, 3, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> does after this favourable Aſpect of Divine Comforts in this Verſe, grow up to a prophetical confidence, in the certain futuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the event, Verſ. 23. And as it had eyed the cauſe, Divine Vengeance, in a Duplication of the Addreſs to it, in the firſt weak act of affiance, Verſ. 1. So alſo, Verſ. laſt, preſents a double Teſtimony of the more eſtabliſhed and ſtrong act of confident aſſurance, that the effect which he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected, ſhould undoubtedly be produced. What he only ſaw the poſſibility of, in the firſt work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of his Faith, he foreſees the Exiſtence of in the laſt; what he only beg'd that it might be, in the infancy of his Faith; he peremptorily con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes, and promiſes himſelf, that it would be in this its Maturity. Then his Faith only wiſhes, here it determines; there was his Suppoſition, here is deſinitive Sentence and Deciſion; that his Prayer, this his Anſwer. The Victory of his Faith over all preceding fears and dubitations. Hope triumphing over his Deſpondency.</p>
               <p>And that Comfort has a ſpecial Influence, thus to heighten Faith, and perfect its actings is appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent from the nature of the thing. For ſince it is the quiet, and reſt of the Mind, upon good Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of the Love of God, to a Man in particular through Chriſt, it can do no other than embold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en his Addreſſes, and encourage his confidence. Even as when a tender Father receives into, and cheriſhes in his boſom, a reconciled Child, and ſpeaks to <hi>his Heart:</hi> This removes fully all thoſe Jealouſies and Doubts, which the remembrance of former unkindneſſes and diſtances might create, and invites the Child to a more inheſitant and free recumbence upon, and committing himſelf to this ſo amply atteſted love and tenderneſs, of his now
<pb n="332" facs="tcp:100687:178"/>no more angry Father: So by the like reaſon it introduces an additional fervour and flame to the Child's love, and engages him to a more full and ingenuous Expreſſion of his dutifulneſs and filial obſervance. And no leſs may be gathered from the <hi>Pſalmiſts</hi> proceſs here: For before the Text, though he have frequent occaſion to make mention of God, almoſt in every one of the foregoing Verſes, <hi>viz.</hi> ten or eleven times; yet 'tis with that ſeeming diſtance and ſtrangeneſs, that we meet not with a word of appropriation to himſelf in ſpecial: But upon the benigne Aſpect of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolations of God, his Love will no longer ſtand off, but makes its neareſt approaches, and runs into his embraces, in a double affectionate claim of Propriety, in the compaſs of four Verſes fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing; as oft as he mentions the Lord, he fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows it with a <hi>Relative,</hi> not permitting it to paſs by, as before, like an Alien. Verſ. 22. <hi>The Lord is my defence, My God is the Rock of my Refuge.</hi> I have now abundant reaſon to follow him with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation Love, as mine own, ſince he <hi>love my Soul into Reſt and Peace,</hi> becoming my Comforter. Oh ſweet reviving token of the ſingular Love of my God! How dearly <hi>do I love him for it?</hi> Yet this is not all. Is this <hi>Honey-comb</hi> for my ſelf alone? Do I arrogate ſole Propriety in theſe Riches? No, my Charity obliges me to Judge, that my Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren in Affliction are not deſtitute of the ſame Conſolation through intereſt in God. I ſo love my Neighbour as to make account he is as good as my ſelf, and has an equal ſhare with me in this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite Treaſure; therefore for <hi>my Brethren and Companions ſake,</hi> I ſay [OUR GOD] without reſtriction to my ſelf. Verſ. 23. <hi>Yea, our God ſhall out them off.</hi> He is a common good; yours
<pb n="333" facs="tcp:100687:178"/>as well as mine, and brings a common benefit to us all, in ſaving us from our Adverſaries. And herein he ſhews, not only his love to Man, and thereby conſequentially that it did reſpect a high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er object, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 4.20, 21. but directly and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately demonſtrates, that he grew in love to God himſelf, in that, he glorifies the Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cativeneſs of Divine Goodneſs, by an acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of its extenſiveneſs, in a peculiar manner to Multitudes beſides himſelf; even all included in the relative [OUR] as if it had been ſaid, <hi>I love him, becauſe he loves me,</hi> ſo as to <hi>be mine: I love him yet more, becauſe he together with me loves mine;</hi> condeſcending to be <hi>theirs</hi> alſo. I love that good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs that flows to me; I further love that good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs that overflows to all with me; my Friends, my People.

               </p>
               <p>Shew then, Oh my Soul, the ſoundneſs of thy Comforts by their Fruits. That Peace which is imprignant is impoſtorous. In what further de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree do thy inward Joys impower thee to <hi>Love the Lord,</hi> the giver, or thy Neighbour, thy Partaker. Canſt thou pretend Peace in thy <hi>Conſcience,</hi> and live in contention or uncharitableneſs with thy Brother? Does not thy inward Comfort calm thy paſſions, meeken thy converſes, render thee pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable, uſeful to Men, in the beſt endeavours to induce them to love God and Vertue, and abhor Immorality, Viciouſneſs and Hypocriſie, that by thy means they may be alſo led in this method, into the way of Peace, and through it again into the way of Purity. If thy Comforts be ſolid and ſincere, thou wilt by them be enabled to uſe the utmoſt diligence in propagating them; ſince that is one of Gods great Deſigns in communicating them. 2 Cor. 1.3, 4. <hi>Bleſſed be God, even the Father of Our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, the Father of Mercies, and the God of all Comfort, who comforteth us in all our Tribulation;</hi> (for what end?) <hi>That we may be able to comfort them which are in any trouble, by the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort wherewith we our ſelves are comforted of God.</hi> And
<pb n="335" facs="tcp:100687:179"/>if God make thee able, thou ought'ſt to be willing. They are only fallacious Joys that are envious. A corrupt Heart, ſo that it ſelf do but enjoy reſt, matters not though all the World be in trouble; nay, grudges others the quiet it enjoys, and tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphs, or ſecretly rejoyces at, or at leaſt is not <hi>afflicted in their Afflictions. Haman</hi> will drink and be jolly, when the whole City is in perplexity. A wicked Soul is not concern'd for the content of any beſide it ſelf, will rather <hi>add Affliction to the afflicted,</hi> than indeavour or rejoyce in their Conſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation. Thy Comfort is not good, if not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formable to the Fountain of <hi>Goodneſs</hi> in Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicativeneſs: As far as confin'd 'tis corrupt. In the Harveſt of true Joys, thy <hi>Jordan</hi> will over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flow the Banks. Uncharritable, illiberal, unboun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful Conſolations are <hi>Illuſions.</hi> If thy light and gladneſs diffuſe not its beneficial rayes abroad, to revive and refreſh the Diſconſolate Heart, 'tis but a glimmering <hi>Meteor,</hi> not a <hi>Beam</hi> from the Sun of Righteouſneſs; and thus does it not extend it ſelf, if a <hi>Vital Heat and Influence</hi> do not accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany it; as 'tis but a flaſhy, wild, deceitful Spark, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 50.11. which will vaniſh into Smoak and dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, if it be not kindled by a flame of true Love to God and Univerſal Righteouſneſs. Wherefore thou canſt never bleſs thy ſelf in reflection upon thine own Peace, if it engage thee not in ſerious cares, to propagate <hi>Holineſs</hi> firſt, and thereby <hi>Peace.</hi> For an unholy Soul is abſolutely inconſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lable for want of <hi>Right,</hi> therefore ſhould be ſo for want of <hi>Will;</hi> ſince a Will to apply Comforts, without <hi>Right,</hi> will certainly reduce to that woful plight, which the Apoſtle, with ſo much concern, reports, 1 Theſ. 5.3. <hi>When they ſhall ſay peace and ſafety; then ſuddain Deſtruction cometh upon them, as

For by publiſhing Peace to thoſe againſt whom thou ſhould'ſt proclaim War from Heaven, thou wilt delude them into everlaſting Death in their Sins, under the mask of Life and Comfort; <hi>but their Blood ſhall be required at thy hands.</hi> God's Ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of Peace, are only conditional, and ſo muſt thine.</p>
               <p>Look to it then, O my Soul, as the one thing needful, in the firſt place, that the <hi>Grace of God bringing Salvation,</hi> and therefore <hi>everlaſting Conſolati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to thee,</hi> do efficaciouſly <hi>teach thee</hi> this <hi>Righteouſneſs,</hi> to be very induſtrious to lead others, (whoſe Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern God ſometimes ſeems to prefer before his own, <hi>Matth.</hi> 5.23, 24. and <hi>Chap.</hi> 12.1, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8.) eſpecially thy Relations, in the right way to Peace, informing their Judgments, rouſing their Conſciences, reproving their Sins, directing their Practice, counſelling, commanding, reſtraining, and conſtraining them, as far as poſſible, to be good, and do good freely, with an ingenuous ſpontaneity and readineſs of mind. But as thou muſt learn others, ſo under the influence of that beneficial Grace, thou thy ſelf muſt be learnt to <hi>deny,</hi> ſo as to crucifie, <hi>all <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ngodlineſs,</hi> ſpiritual Evil, <hi>and worldly Luſts,</hi> carnal Wickedneſs, <hi>and live ſoberly,</hi> in a juſt temper and moderation of thine own Spirit, Affections, Paſſions, Appetite; <hi>and godlily,</hi> in a religious aſſiduity of Endeavour to pleaſe the Lord, and approve thy ſelf to him
<pb n="337" facs="tcp:100687:180"/>through Chriſt, in all things. This is both the true undeceiving Mean to attain Comfort, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo the certain and inſeparable Fruit of it: The more thou groweſt herein, the more redundant will be thy ſatisfaction; and if, on the other hand, <hi>thy Peace be as a River, thy Righteouſneſs will be as the waves of the Sea, Iſai.</hi> 48.18.</p>
               <p>Try then thy Comfort by its Productions: If it will permit thee to diſhonour God and defile thy Conſcience, to be vain in thy Spirit, and vile in thy Communication and Converſation, to debauch others, and damn thy ſelf, neither fearing God, nor regarding Man, nor valuing and taking care for thine own ſelf, 'tis no better than its Progeny, and will but only lead thee hood-wink'd, in a plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing dream of Paradiſe, into the depth of Hell: But contrarily, if thy Peace be procreative, and bring forth Twins, a heavenly Spirit, and a holy Life: If it be as the Dew to thy Graces, and cauſe them to flouriſh, and yield their Fruit in due ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon: If it enlarge thy heart God-ward, and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry thee as upon Eagles Wings to thy Redeemer, in a more intire, affectionate, cordial ſubjection to his Authority and Government, its Origin is Heaven, and in thoſe everlaſting Pleaſures and Joys will it finally terminate. Leading thee to ſound and real Goodneſs, it will undoubtedly iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſue in that <hi>far more exceeding and eternal weight of Glory.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>Reprehenſive</hi> part of this kind of Inferences, cannot be omitted; happy we if there were no reaſon for it. I only will proſecute it in one Inſtance.</p>
               <p>Therefore juſt Matter of Challenge and Rebuke will ariſe upon this Doctrine, for ſitting down under the Perplexities of our own mad Thoughts;
<pb n="338" facs="tcp:100687:181"/>without a due care to prepare for, and poſſeſs our ſelves of the Comforts of God. I confeſs the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerality of Men are preſumptuouſly bold in divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding theſe, and with a daring Impudence will raſhly arreſt the Promiſes, with a heady Violence rack and torture them, or cut and mangle them, (as <hi>Sciron</hi> and <hi>Procruſtes</hi> did all Paſſengers) till they ſeem to be made fit for their own Beds, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come unwillingly willing to lie down with them. Comfort muſt conform to them, they will not to it. But theſe will certainly inherit Confuſion, when thoſe raviſh'd Comforts relinquiſh their too ſate awakened Souls at Death; or lie down in the moſt grievous Horrors, if before that diſmal hour they be ever rouſed into Repentance. And oft it falls out that thoſe who moſt audaciouſly uſurp'd Divine Conſolations in their impenitent Eſtate, become moſt ſhy of them after their real awakenings; they dare not be deluded again, by an over-forwardneſs; their aſſuming to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves Peace without Right before, coſt them ſo dear, that it makes them more jealous, ſuſpici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, and cantious in bottoming it, ere they can adventure again to apply the Promiſes. But as Preſumption leads ſome blindfold into a falſe Peace, ſo Deſpair cauſes many to reject a true. Some receive this at the hands of Juſtice, as a me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rited Puniſhment for aggravated Sins, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craſtination of Repentance, to be judicially given up by the Lord to Horrors of Conſcience, ſo deep, ſo durable, as not to be able to ſee any thing but Terror in the whole Book of God, till he remit this Puniſhment, and lighten his hand. Others are knock'd off from the Promiſes by the Spirit of Bondage, in a ſmart and home-conviction of Sin and divine indignation becauſe of it; God
<pb n="339" facs="tcp:100687:181"/>hereby deſigning to make them more meet for it. And indeed none are more afraid of receiving Comfort than thoſe, that being throughly ſtartled with the diſcoveries of their Corruptions and God's juſt Anger, do really ſtand in moſt need of it, and are under the divine Methods of Prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration for it. Such ſtand off, and diſpute their own Title, either, 1. through Ignorance or In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>advertency, not underſtanding or conſidering themſelves, and the Work of God within them: Or, 2. through Humility and Tenderneſs, as a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraid of preſuming: Or, 3. through a Spice of Pride and Haughtineſs, as reſolv'd to bring their Peny to the Promiſe, ('tis Mr. <hi>Hooker</hi>'s Phraſe); not content with ſuch Qualifications as God limits in the Word, in order to Peace, they muſt ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per-errogate in their Preparations, and be better than they can be, ſtill complaining of Unworthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, Unworthineſs, (which in one ſence is true) as if they would not receive Comfort, <hi>gratis,</hi> nor accept of the Gift upon God's Terms, making them need it, and meet for it; except they be, (which none poſſibly can be) worthy of it, merit and deſerve it. Or, laſtly, through a kind of obſtinacy and ſtubbornneſs of Spirit, and the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dominancy of Melancholy, (to which every thing that is ſaddening and dejecting, hath too much of agreeableneſs and ſweetneſs,) as if they were in love with their Griefs and Woes; will not attend to any rational or religious Arguments, that might relieve them, <hi>Rachel</hi>-like refuſing to be <hi>comforted,</hi> although they can give no juſt and ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfying reaſon, for that <hi>Recuſancy.</hi> It may be they are pleaſed with the Senſuality of Sorrow, becauſe it hits their Humour, harmonizes with their Dumpiſhneſs, and gives them a little eaſe,
<pb n="340" facs="tcp:100687:182"/>by cheriſhing their Diſeaſe as Water in a Dropſie. Neither can I render any other reaſon, why o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers who pretend higher, ſhould imagine they can never be exceſſive enough in their grief for Sin, but are ſtill ambitions to find their <hi>Head be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come Waters, and theirs Eyes a Fountain of Tears, that they may weep day and night;</hi> which if they ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience in any deſired meaſure, then are they well ſatisfied, and at eaſe, making this an Ingre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient of their Comfort, ſtiling it melting and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing affected; which when they feel not, they are all upon the whine, and cannot be reconciled to their more deep, ſolid, and leſs ſuperficial Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentings and Dolors. But this womaniſh part of Repentance in God's <hi>Whinls</hi> (as one uſed to call them), though in its due degree and place deſira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and commendable, yet is the leaſt conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and loweſt thing in it; as every judicious Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine and Chriſtian very well knows, being only ſenſitive, not deliberative or ſpiritual in its riſe and acting, and real nature; and the former, <hi>viz.</hi> melancholick Penſiveneſs, and delight there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, is no part of Repentance at all, but only an effort of natural Conſtitution, or a gratification thereof, including nothing reaſonable and humane, nor divine and ſpiritual. No more is any thing in that Perſon, who cannot ſatisfactorily reſolve that <hi>Quaere</hi> of the Pſalmiſt, <hi>Why art thou caſt down, ob my Soul? And why art thou diſquieted within me? Pſal.</hi> 42. <hi>ult.</hi> For this is diſtinctive of ſound trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and unſound; the former has ſome ſpecial and particular Matter, as a reaſon and ground to al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge for it ſelf; the latter either can give no rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon at all, or hovers in the wild confuſion of ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerals; whence it ſprings, and how it riſes, and for what it is, lies in the dark. Let not that paſs
<pb n="341" facs="tcp:100687:182"/>then for right trouble, which cannot give a juſt account of it ſelf at the bar of Reaſon, guided by the Word of God: and if it cannot ſtand there, how will it plead before the Tribunal of Chriſt? Where we muſt render a reaſon <hi>of all things done in the Fleſh, whether good or evil,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.10. the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Thoughts of the heart being there to be judged, <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.15, 16. troubled and troubling thoughts as well as others. As then thoſe are infinitely blame-worthy, who maintain an ungrounded Peace in their minds, although their hearts have never been ſenſible, and ſick of their native habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual enmity againſt God and Holineſs, and will not be beaten out of their preſumptuous confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence in the Goodneſs and Covenant of God, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though altogether unqualified; and thoſe alſo who being a little chaſtized with the Whips and Scor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pions of the Law, in a tart Conviction, and Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror of Conſcience, ſoon grow weary of the bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then and pain; and being more ſick of their Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roſives, than their Corruptions, begin Dog-like to lick whole their Sores, and will have the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes right or wrong, as a lenitive or ſtupefactive rather, to eaſe their pains, or deſtroy their ſence; (though the Core abide within) and being well-pleas'd, and ſatisfy'd with the palliate Cure, trail on a little while 'till the more deep lancings of a thorough Conviction diſcover the deceit; or the incurable gangrene break out at Death and Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, to their ineffable Horror: So likewiſe are they worthy to be greatly blamed, on the other hand, who are really ſick, but afraid of Balm, and the Phyſician; and though every Sin be made grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous, and pain them at the very heart, and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in the World would be more acceptable than a Saviour, whom to ſubject themſelves to
<pb n="342" facs="tcp:100687:183"/>they appear heartily reſolved, and willing to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace every one of his Laws; yet make danger of applying to themſelves, and taking encouragement from his Promiſes of Mercy (that <hi>in Him are Yea, and in Him, Amen</hi>) becauſe, forſooth, they are not ſo and ſo humbled, holy, affectionate, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> As if 'twas not Evangelical New Covenant-Perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, <hi>i. e. <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>prightneſs,</hi> but <hi>Legal, Perſonal, <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal,</hi> and <hi>Perpetual Obedience,</hi> which God requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red as the Condition of the Covenant of Grace, and they muſt not dare to accept of Chriſt and his Benefits, except they were ſo good before-hand as to ſtand in no need of them. But why I beſeech you thus in love with your own Torture, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſirous ſtill to abide upon the Rack of Anxiety and Dolour? Trouble is not its own end. God does not wound our Conſciences, or crucifie our Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort in carnal Things, merely becauſe he loves to torment us, or that we may be Devils to our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, by protracting our own Woes beyond the bounds of <hi>Decorum</hi> and Neceſſity. He only de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns by the <hi>Antiperiſtaſis</hi> of our Sorrows, more to ſweeten the Joys of his Salvation, which he hath prepared for us; and by mingling Gall and Worm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wood with our delicious Sins, to embitter that, which only prepares us for, and aſſigns us over unto the direful Miſeries of everlaſting Damnation.</p>
               <p>In brief, one would not think that the reaſon of any could be reconcil'd to their own Woes, much leſs their Senſe: Yet common Experience tells us, that ſome will every moment be conjuring up new Fiends to torture themſelves; and ſeem to ſtudy nothing elſe, but by fetching in all the Fuel they can poſſibly reach, and all the Fire that divine Vengeance breaths out in the Scriptures, to kindle a Hell in their own Conſciences; as
<pb n="343" facs="tcp:100687:183"/>though Miſery were their proper Element, and infinitely more deſirable than divine Mercy, which they ſolicitouſly fly from, and with all imaginable Artifice and Induſtry fence againſt, as if in a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicious Malice againſt themſelves, they were ſure 'twould be their utter undoing to be happy. Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption, Temptation, and a dark cloudy Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexion, with confederate ſtrength and ſtrata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gems, beſiege and ſtorm their Imaginations; which having inveſted, from thence, as a ſtrong Cita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>del, they batter down their Reaſon, ſo that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing can be heard or regarded, but what will take the ſtronger ſide, to war againſt Comfort and God. Diſplay before them all the amiable Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of Infinite Goodneſs and Love, in its wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful deſcents to the Chief of Sinners, with whoſe Tranſgreſſions their ſober Conſiderations cannot dare to equal their own: Repreſent to their view in a clear Heaven of Light, the incomprehenſible Glories and Condeſcenſions of the ever to be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mired and adored <hi>Son of Righteouſneſs;</hi> whoſe aſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhing Free Grace induced him to be willing for the ſake of loſt Mankind, to ſuffer an Eclipſe un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der that thick Cloud of divine Vengeance, which was due for the Sins, not of one particular Sinner only, but of the whole World; and the Merit of whoſe Paſſion was ſufficient to expiate the Sins of infinite Worlds; yet will they ſcarce allow this to be a balance for their own. Lay open before their Eyes the rich and glorious Treaſury of the divine Promiſes, and gracious Invitations to ſuch as are under like Circumſtances with theirs; and therefore to them as fully and clearly, as if their Names were engraven in the Front of every one of thoſe Bonds upon God's Fidelity, or theſe writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten upon their own Foreheads, or proclaimed to
<pb n="344" facs="tcp:100687:184"/>them by name from Heaven. Diſcover to them with the brighteſt Evidence, that their Spirit, Condition, Frame, and Preparations, are really ſuch as God hath deſcribed and required, as the ſole Conditions of his Grace and Mercy; and that there is as perfect an Agreement betwixt their inward Senſations and State, and thoſe God will certainly own and embrace with his Love, as can reaſonably be expected and deſired: Yet will they find ſome ſubtle, cunning, ſtudied evaſions and ſhifts to perſwade themſelves and others, that they have ſome reaſon to be mad, in rejecting all; and will ſtifly argue againſt their own inward ſenſe and feeling, and lye againſt their own Experience, rather than by receiving theſe Comforts, comply with the Bounty and Kindneſs of Heaven, that ſo freely and graciouſly tenders them.</p>
               <p>Why then doſt thou contend againſt thy ſelf, oh my Soul! and quarrel with the admirable Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſcenſions, the moſt bountiful Tenders, Largeſs, and Munificence of Heaven? Art thou weary of thy Sins, and under a practical Conviction of their abominable offenſiveneſs to God, heartily willing to relinquiſh all; following thy deſires and reſolutions hereof with ſerious Cares and Endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours, not abiding the very thoughts or hanker<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of thy heart that lean towards them, care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully avoiding all Occaſions, Temptations, Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, which might irritate thee to commit them, in indignation and revenge againſt thy ſelf for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulging thy ſelf in them; now reſolutely bent with the Aid of God to mortifie them, and not to ſpare hands, feet, or eyes, the moſt ſweet and endearing <hi>Dalilahs,</hi> thy Maſter-reigning Sins, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutional, cuſtomary, pleaſing, profitable Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions, recommended by Age, Calling, publick
<pb n="345" facs="tcp:100687:184"/>Allowance, Practice, which to forbear may ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe to Scoffs, Scorns, Sufferings, Death it ſelf, as in Times of Perſecution. Art thou daily in bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terneſs of Soul for them? Are they evermore in their odious Nature and Aggravations before thee? Art thou watchful againſt them, and unto the contrary Duties, Graces, and holy Exerciſes, that there is not one Law of God, which tis not thy earneſt deſire and labour to obſerve, heartily im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploring the ſtrength of Heaven to engage in all for thee, and manifeſt its Might in thy Weakneſs? And when thou haſt done thy beſt, haſt thou learnt to deny thy ſelf <hi>as an unprofitable Servant, having only done what</hi> (nay far leſs than) <hi>thou oughteſt?</hi> Not daring to omit any part of thy Work, nor when done moſt exactly, to make a Chriſt of it: but committing thy Perſon and Performances, by Faith into his gracious hands, to be preſented to his Father, ſprinkled with his Blood of Satisfaction, perfumed with his Incenſe of Interceſſion; nothing but divine Free Grace, through Chriſt's Mediation, becomes the ſole Support and Stay of thy Hopes, as well as the Foundation of thy Faith; maintaining in all a ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver-ceaſing Jealouſie over thy ſlippery, treache<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous heart, leſt it ſtain all thy Actions with Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>purity, or corrupt all thy Intentions by Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>criſie; a Sin to be fear'd and wreſtled againſt, above all other, thy perpetual dread and hate? Is this thy ſtate, frame, and deportment? And yet doſt thou boggle at the Promiſes, and ſtart aſide in averſation from, or a rejection of their refreſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Conſolations, upon I know not what frivo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous Pretences? Oh thy Folly! Oh thy Fury! For beſide the infinite wrong to thy ſelf, both as a knocking of the Wheels, that thou doſt but drive
<pb n="346" facs="tcp:100687:185"/>heavily in God's Service, and a living in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fines or a corner of Hell, when <hi>Heaven is opening to thee its everlaſting Gates;</hi> thou alſo blaſphemeſt the unconfinable Goodneſs and Love of thy hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly Father, the affectionate Bowels and Grace of thy compaſſionate Redeemer; thou grieveſt the Holy ſealing Spirit of Grace and Peace, and giveſt the lye to the Promiſes; Sins as Helliſh, as any thou haſt already renounc'd and forſaken. Has Almighty Love and Grace check'd the exorbitan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies of thy diſſolute licentious Will and Affections, bounded the raging Sea of thy Luſts, inſomuch that thou dareſt not, wilt'ſt not paſs the limits he hath confin'd thee to by his Laws? Hath God en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abled thee with a free undiſſembled Conſent to embrace the Conditions of the Covenant, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penting, and chearfully giving up thy ſelf to be governed in all things by the ever-bleſſed <hi>Son of God,</hi> which is a performance of thy part of the Covenant? And can'ſt thou conceit that infinite Fidelity, which gives thee the power to do all this, and works in thee to obſerve thy part, will not be real and faithful, in perfecting what con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns himſelf on his part, but that his Covenant is mere Colluſion; that he hath only brought thee into a Fool's Paradiſe, and all his great and precious Promiſes, are only great and pompous Nothings, not worthy to be rely'd on? That he hath done all this for thee, carry'd thee thorough the burthen and heat of the day, and tenders thee thine Hire, yet will be angry if thou accept it. For why doſt thou not receive and enjoy the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts of the Promiſes and Perfections of God, ſo liberally preſented to thy embracement, ſo ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by their amiable Aſpect inviting thee? Is it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they do not ſuit thee, are not proper and
<pb n="347" facs="tcp:100687:185"/>ſufficient to revive thee? Is it becauſe thou needeſt them not, deſireſt them not? No, nothing of this Nature. What then is the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, oh my Soul? They are fit for thee, but thou art not fit for them, not duly prepar'd. That's ſomething, if true. But who told thee ſo, God or the Devil? If God, ſhew the Scripture. <hi>Out of the Law and Teſtimony</hi> muſt thou produce <hi>ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing</hi> more than I have deſcribed, that God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires to qualifie thee for his Mercy. Something more than an unfergned owning his Covenant, in ſerious reſolution, care, endeavour, and indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrious, laborious diligence to go through with thy part of it, under the influence of his Power and Grace, and Holy Spirit. Doth Satan tell thee that this is not due Preparation? And doſt thou, dar'ſt thou believe him rather than God? God forbid.</p>
               <p>Where then doſt thou ſtick? What art thou afraid of? Is there any thing to be feared but Sin? There 'tis: Thou art afraid of ſinning by too haſty applying the Promiſes for thy revival. A very laudable Fear. 'Tis well that Sin is dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful. Stand to that. Be then alſo afraid to ſin, by refuſing to apply them, thereby continuing thy perplexities. For 'tis very certain,
<list>
                     <item>1. That 'tis a Sin not to ſerve God chearfully, with Love; eſpecially when he hath done for us whatever is neceſſary to engage us thereto. If he have in reality prepar'd thee for thoſe Comforts, which he hath prepar'd for thee, he hath done that, upon account whereof he will expect thy ready, ingenuous, affectionate Obedience, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thou be ſatisfy'd as to thy Preparations or no. But if thou ſtill refuſeſt his Comforts, and protracteſt thy Troubles, thou eludeſt the higheſt Engagement to love him, and in deſpite of his
<pb n="348" facs="tcp:100687:186"/>Goodneſs perſevereſt to do his work as a Slave on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, wilt not as a Child, which is a high Affront to thy Father.</item>
                     <item>2. 'Tis a Sin to reject God's Offers, a Scorn put upon his Goodneſs to refuſe his Free Gifts. When he creates a Storm in our Thoughts, and drives us before the blaſt of his Indignation, into the Port of real Holineſs, then does he generouſly ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der us thoſe needful refreſhments, which will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vive our weather-beaten Souls; can we now ſpurn them away from us, and be innocent? Here therefore is Sin on both hands. How ſhall we caſt the balance? We muſt not ſin our ſelves into Comfort, neither muſt we ſin it away. Cut the hair. Well then, all depends upon this, the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termination, what is too haſty, what too ſlow ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication of Promiſes? And this upon the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceding <hi>Quaere,</hi> what is due Preparation? For to apply Promiſes, when rightly qualified, is no Sin, but Duty; therefore to neglect it is Sin. Then are we too haſty, when we run before we are bidden, not otherwiſe. God by creating in us the pre-required Promiſe-diſpoſitions, bids us take all the Bleſſings in the Promiſe which they diſpoſe for. <hi>When the Condition is perform'd, the Covenant is a Command to accept its Merey,</hi> which cannot be refuſed without diſobedience to God. 'Twould be ſtrange petulancy, when Chriſt ſays, <hi>Come ye Bleſſed of my Father, inher it the Kingdom,</hi> &amp;c. to reply, no, I dare not, I am not qualify'd. Such is the refuſal to inherit his Comforts, when he hath wrought in us their Conditions. And if the foremention'd be not, where are they? Remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, Oh my Soul, thou liveſt not under the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of Works, but of Grace: And if thou doubteſt of thy Preparations, reſume thy Work, try them
<pb n="349" facs="tcp:100687:186"/>better, make them ſounder, that thy ſecond and renew'd Eſſays may be unqueſtionable. Yet re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member alſo, that 'tis a grievous Sin to belye thy ſelf, and deny God's Work; he expects thou ſhould'ſt conſider, and <hi>own the Operation of his Hands,</hi> and give him the Glory of the Fruits of his Love in thy Regeneration. Take heed of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining the <hi>Truth</hi> in the <hi>Priſon of <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nrighteouſneſs:</hi> Be juſt to God and thy ſelf. Do not dare to bla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpheme his Grace, by attributing it to other Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes.

               <p>I anſwer, 2. That God's moral Motion is an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tecedent to, and leads <hi>all Phyſical,</hi> his or ours. For ſince he inclines in a way ſuitable to our Nature, as he himſelf, as we, and all rational Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures act, where the Mind and Reaſon leads the Will, and inclines it; therefore by preſenting Objects and Reaſons, urging and enforcing them
<pb n="350" facs="tcp:100687:187"/>by ſenſe and feeling of miſery, diſquiet of heart, and woe, God ſtrives with thy Will to move it freely, to embrace thoſe freely-offer'd Comforts, without which thou perceiveſt thy ſelf plainly to be ready to ſink into Horror and Deſpair. But thou againſt both divine Reaſon, and thine own Senſe, ſtiffly, irrationally, and malapartly refuſeſt to yield to either; and yet art ſo ſottiſh as to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute thy Frenzy to God. Avaunt Blaſphemy. If the mighty important Perſwaſives of Heaven cannot prevail upon thee as a Man, never imagine that the Almightineſs of God will miraculouſly drag thee as a Beaſt, or a Block, into that Paradiſe of Reſt and Satisfaction, which now thou ſtartleſt and trembleſt at. And underſtand that if thou be'ſt a Rebel againſt the Reaſon of God, thou wilt alſo be a Fighter againſt the Power of God. If a ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional Mind act in repugnancy to his Wiſdom, much more will an irrational, brutiſh Will a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt his Omnipotence; there being leſs averſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in any Man to be ſubdu'd by the Golden Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty of forcible Arguments, than the Iron-ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity of <hi>Club-Law.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The reſult is, that to refuſe divine Comforts when qualified for them, is an evident fighting a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt God, and to deny our Qualifications, when heartily grieved for, and undiſſembledly willing and active to divorce from, and never return to any thing diſpleaſing to <hi>God, the Father, Son, and Holy Ghoſt,</hi> and unfeignedly deſirous, and diligent to eſpouſe the Divine Intereſt in all things, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out tergiverſation or delay: This is an apparent Rebellion and Lye againſt the Holy Ghoſt, and our own Souls; which, Oh my Soul, there is an abſolute neceſſity, that thou ſhould'ſt be much more afraid of, than thy mere imaginary Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption
<pb n="351" facs="tcp:100687:187"/>in accepting that which is ſo clearly and freely tendered to thee by God. And what doſt thou mean herein, oh fooliſh and unkind to thy ſelf, oh ingrateful, and impious againſt God, that the wiſe, and rich, and ſweet Proviſions of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, in boundleſs Compaſſions to thy Neceſſity and Miſery, laid at thy Feet, ſhould be trod in the Dirt? That thou wilt not vouchſafe to be ſo mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciful to thy ſelf, and reſpectful to God, as to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit his healing Balms to be poured into thy bleed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Wounds; but in a blind Zeal againſt thy un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy ſelf, or an over-righteous Revenge a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt thy abhorred Sins, or an humorous Pee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſhneſs, or Pertinacy of Spirit, or I know not what, woundeſt thoſe gracious Hands, which, in infinite Tenderneſs and Commiſeration, offer ſo benignly, by theſe moſt effectual Medicines againſt all Anxiety and Woe, to deliver thee out of thy weariſome Hoſpital, into an everlaſting Heaven of Pleaſure, Joy, Peace, Soundneſs, Safety, Reſt, and Conſolation? Oh thy Madneſs! to chuſe thy Miſeries and Vexations, rather than ſo bleſſed an hope, ſo unutterable Happineſs. What! be fond of Hell, and dote on thy Torment, and prefer thy Prelibations of eternal Plagues and Horrors, before theſe Earneſts of thoſe unſpeakably glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, future Recompences? Is it not even ſo? This is and well may it be for a Lamentation.</p>

               <p>Every diſquieted Heart is melted into a paſſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate longing after Peace. If it can but ſee any dawnings of a lightſom day of Joy, after the gloo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my night of its Troubles: If after all its tremu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous Palpitations, and Paſſions, and Horrors, it may be ſupported with the Revivings of the leaſt glimmering Hope, that God will entertain any Thoughts of Reconciliation; it ſeems to glory in a willingneſs to be, or do any thing; to ſubmit to any Terms whatever, that may be conducible to this happy and amicable Cloſure. To pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote this bleſſed End, and compromiſe of diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences betwixt incenſed Heaven, and trembling, afflicted Souls, the <hi>Son of God</hi> hath done his part in the way of Mediation, as the <hi>Father</hi> hath done his, by revealing his Covenant and Promiſe, with the Terms upon which he will be at Peace, and his readineſs to embrace every one that ſubmits to them; both the Father and the Son have far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther contributed towards this, by the Miſſion of the <hi>Holy Ghoſt, the Comforter,</hi> who waits in the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtry of God's Word, and other Ordinances, to be gracious to unworthy Sinners, in illuminating their Minds, and bowing their Hearts and Wills, to
<pb n="353" facs="tcp:100687:188"/>comply with the Will of God, and entertain Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions of Peace, and accept of their own Mercy. God's Miniſters alſo, under theſe divine Influen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, take their Task in hand, as Inſtruments by way of Propoſal, in explicating, and directing about theſe Terms; in propounding, offering, urging, counſelling, perſwading, exhorting to yield to them: And unworthy I, amongſt the reſt, would here contribute my Mite, to promote the Eſtabliſhment of true and ſolid Conſolation, in an endeavour to guide (doctrinally, as my Lord and Maſter does phyſically and efficaciouſly) poor wand'ring Feet into the <hi>Pſalmiſt</hi>'s experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented way to Peace, as far as there are any Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neaments and Footſteps thereof in the Pſalm; and this with all convenient brevity, becauſe ſome of the Rules have upon other Occaſions offered them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to Conſideration.</p>

                  <item>1. <hi>Be Men of Thoughts.</hi> Exerciſe your ſelves in Meditation. As there can be no Diſcomfort, ſo neither Comfort, without a multitude of Thoughts. For if they only ſwim upon the Surface of the Mind, they will but introduce a ſuperficial Trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble or Reſt. Thoughts that ſink, and ſoak in, go to the bottom, and reach the moſt intimate Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſes of the Soul (as the <hi>Pſalmiſt</hi>'s, <hi>in intimo meo</hi>) Thoughts that ſtick by us, and are not eaſily ſhak'd off, but follow us night and day, theſe are moſt cumberſome or comfortable. Men of deſul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory Minds, that cannot ſettle their Cogitations, but rove, and ramble, and skip like a Squirrel from Bough to Bough, from Tree to Tree, are here, and there, and every where, throughout all the Ramifications of Thoughts, yet no where fix'd; as a Weather-cock may now face a bluſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Storm, and in a moment the ſweet and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſhing
<pb n="354" facs="tcp:100687:189"/>Sun, but never feel any thing, never taſt any durable Diſquiets or Joys. Lay up there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore a good Stock before-hand of heart-relieving Conſiderations, as an Antidote to all ſadning, moleſting Paſſions. This no doubt was the <hi>Pſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſt</hi>'s Practice. Thoſe reviving Meditations, which he afterward digeſted into this Pſalm, did dwell in his mind before, in, and upon the firſt Aſſaults of his Trouble, and did their Work with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in him before he committed this Narrative to Writing. What he felt then, he here diſcovers. 'Twould be nauſeous to recollect and repeat here thoſe Cogitations, which I have all this while been obſerving out of the Pſalm, that influenced his troubled heart, and eſtabliſhed it in Peace; tedious to make new Obſervations throughout the Pſalm, where they very plentifully occur. I ſhall only therefore take notice of a few Verſes, and I cannot furniſh you with a richer Treaſury of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent, calming, comforting Thoughts, than are preſented in <hi>Ver.</hi> 12, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Take it according to the Tranſlation. <hi>Bleſſed is the Man whom thou chaſt'neſt, O Lord, and teacheſt out of thy Law.</hi> 13. <hi>That thou may'ſt give him Reſt from the days of Adverſity, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til the Pit be digged for the Wicked.</hi> 14. <hi>For the Lord will not caſt off his People, neither will be forſake his Inheritance.</hi> 15. <hi>But Judgment ſhall return unto Righteouſneſs, and all the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>pright in heart ſhall fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low it.</hi> Here we behold the Condition of Man, troublous under chaſt'ning: But,

'Tis comfortable in that 'tis only Child-like Diſcipline, as the Word both in Hebrew and Greek imports, and therefore proceeds from the Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, Heart, Love, and compaſſionate Bowels of a Father. There cannot be more ſmart in the Rod, which is at the worſt but a finite Evil, than there
<pb n="355" facs="tcp:100687:189"/>is ſweet in the <hi>Love</hi> that manages it, and is of an infinite Vertue and Satisfactorineſs. Then ſence and feeling of that, is bitter and grievous, but the importance moſt pleaſing and delectable. How lamentable would thy Caſe be, ſhould the Lord ſpare the Rod, and leave thee to harden thy ſelf in thy evil Manners; that is, forbear all Deſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings for thy good, that thy Damnation may be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come more inevitable, and ſuperſede his Corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions preventive of thy Sins and Woes, that Hell may the more certainly devour and conſume thee? Happy Croſs, that is an Index of the good Will of God, that is a demonſtration that thou art a Child of God, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.5, 6, 7, 8, 9.</item>
                        <item>2. 'Tis a bleſſed thing to be chaſtized, the greateſt Curſe to be forborn, as a Token of being devoted to everlaſting Curſes. God has not par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned thoſe he does not puniſh; no, their Guilt eſcapes a preſent Reckoning, becauſe the Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Judge intends to pay them home in another World. If thy Father in Heaven forbear thee not, 'tis becauſe he hath forgiven thee the eternal Penalty; and that's a bleſſed thing indeed, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 32.1, 2. Sin muſt ſmart; if thou be'ſt made to feel its Evil by Corrections now, 'tis to prevent the more grievous Pains of another Life. God deſigns thy good by bringing upon thee theſe Evils, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.10. and his Purpoſes can never admit of a fruſtration.</item>
                        <item>3. Theſe Chaſtenings are only a burthen laid upon one, who by Grace is, or ſhall be made ſtrong, or mighty, to bear and improve them. 'Tis not <hi>Adam Earthly</hi> Man, nor <hi>Enoſh ſickly, weak</hi> Man, but <hi>[Haggeber]</hi> the ſtrong,<note place="margin">

                        <item>4. 'Tis <hi>Jehovah,</hi> the Performer of Promiſes, that chaſtizes; and therefore his chaſtening it ſelf, is not the Execution of the Old-Covenant Threatning to a Child of God, but a fulfilling of
<pb n="357" facs="tcp:100687:190"/>a New-Covenant Promiſe. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 89. <hi>If the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of him whom God makes his Firſt-born, Ver.</hi> 27. <hi>and his Throne as the days of Heaven, Ver.</hi> 29. <hi>do forſake my Law, &amp;c. Ver.</hi> 30. <hi>Then will I viſit their Tranſgreſſion with the Rod, and their Iniquity with Stripes.</hi> I call this a Promiſe, not a Threat, nor a bare Aſſeveration (becauſe inſerted as Matter of Privilege, amidſt a Cluſter of Promiſes, true in a ſence of <hi>David,</hi> but redounding to Chriſt and his Children and Seed, <hi>Heb.</hi> 2.13. <hi>Iſ.</hi> 53.10.) But (as to <hi>Iſrael</hi> in <hi>Aegypt,</hi> ſo) to all his ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual <hi>Iſrael,</hi> when in their moſt grievous Agonies and Oppreſſions, he reveals himſelf by his Name <hi>Jehovah,</hi> in a peculiar manner: For to no Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion are more Promiſes made, to none more ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fill'd.

                        <item>5. God's Corrections are Inſtructions; the Word ſignifies both; and however to the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of God, they are inſeparable. If God thus teach, with a ſtrong Hand, he will alſo teach out of his Law. <hi>Job</hi> 34.31, 32. <hi>Elihu</hi> there accounts it a very proper Petition, <hi>Surely it is meet to be ſaid to God, I have born Chaſtiſement, I will not of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend any more; what I ſee not, teach thou me: If I have done Iniquity, I will do no more.</hi> Therefore <hi>David, Pſal.</hi> 119.71. profeſſes, <hi>It is good for me that I have been afflicted, that I might learn thy Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes.</hi> Our bleſſed Redeemer was in this an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent Pattern, <hi>Heb.</hi> 5.8. <hi>Though he were a Son, yet learned he Obedience by the things which he ſuffered.</hi> And God Almighty declares his conſident expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctation of this from his People, <hi>Zeph.</hi> 3.7. <hi>I ſaid,

But <hi>Mic.</hi> 6.9. <hi>The Lords Voice</hi> (the voice of his Rod) <hi>cryeth unto the City, and Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom ſhall ſee thy Name, hear ye the Rod,</hi> (the Lord's voice in it) <hi>and him that hath appointed it.</hi>

                        <item>6. <hi>God chaſtens in order to Reſt. Reſt from Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſity, and the Days of Adverſity. Reſt not meri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, but given, and given by</hi> Jehovah, that can command it, who is a ſelf-mover, and free in his Communications, and when in thee there's no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to be a motive to his Bounty, can and does take Arguments from himſelf. Thy Miſeries ſhall have an end, and a happy end. They ſhall iſſue in that which is an earneſt and pledge of the higheſt Happineſs, <hi>Reſt, Everlaſting Reſt.</hi> Thy Week-day Labours, and Sorrows, and Sufferings, ſhall terminate in a bleſſed <hi>Sabbatiſm;</hi> even in this Life if God ſee it good, however in the Life to come, God will give it, and then who can with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold it?</item>
                        <item>7. All the while thou art in Miſery thou liveſt under diſtinguiſhing Mercy. Thou art not rank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the Wicked, nor reſerv'd for their Woes. In chaſtening thee God differences thee from them, who though they live in a Paradiſe of Proſperity, yet even there (as <hi>Adam</hi>) are dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging their own Graves, and burying all their good Fortunes. Whilſt the Lord chaſtens thee out of thy Sins they are ſinning themſelves into Plagues, beyond the dimenſion of Chaſtenings. Thou art only carryed through a bleſſed Purgatory, they
<pb n="359" facs="tcp:100687:191"/>into and left in the Pit of Perdition, which their own Sins and God's Juſtice are preparing for them; and thy Sufferings ſhall laſt no longer, than till their Iniquities be full, and the Pit made rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to receive them, in which work both their own Wickedneſs, and Divine Vengeance make haſt. <hi>Their Foot ſhall ſlide in due time, for the day of their Calamity is at hand, and the things that ſhall come upon them make haſt. For the Lord ſhall judge his People, and repent himſelf for his Servants, when he ſeeth that their Power is gone, and there is none ſhut up or left,</hi> Deut. 32.35, 36. <hi>Rejoyce, Ob ye Nations there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore with his People,</hi> Ver. 43. <hi>Therefore thus ſaith the Lord God of Hoſts, Ob my People that dwelleſt in Zion, be not afraid of the Aſſyrian, He ſhall ſmite thee with a Rod, and ſhall lift up his Staff againſt thee af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the manner of Aegypt. For yet a very little while and the Indignation ſhall ceaſe and mine Anger in their Deſtruction,</hi> Iſa. 10.24, 25.</item>
                        <item>8. Thy Affliction is not unto Rejection and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſertion, as in the Wicked. <hi>The Lord will not caſt off and forſake, though he chaſten,</hi> ver. 14. no, but own and return unto his Servants. Although he may ſometimes ſeem to depart, yet 'tis with yerning Bowels, and a returning Heart, and the reaſon of this is that</item>
                        <item>9. He owns his Propriety, even when he cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rects. They are <hi>his People, his Inheritance,</hi> an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance that cannot, that ſhall not be alienated. The Devil and Wicked Men may by God's Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion uſurp and make a forcible Intruſion and Entry, but the legal Right abides with God, and he will infallibly recover it, in his own way and time. Joh. 10.27, 28, 29. <hi>My Sheep hear my voice, and I know them, and they follow me, and I give unto them Eternal Life, and they ſhall never periſh, neither
<pb n="360" facs="tcp:100687:192"/>ſhall any pluck them out of my hand. My Father which gave them me is greater than all, and no Man is able to pluck them out of my Fathers hand.</hi>
                        </item>
                        <item>10. <hi>The Lord will be thy Patron and Advocate,</hi> to plead thy Righteous cauſe, that although Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment be departed from Righteouſneſs, <hi>i. e.</hi> Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>righteous Judgment be paſt againſt thee, yet God will turn the Scales, and cauſe Judgment at length to weigh thee in a right Balance, and ſentence ſhall be given on thy ſide.</item>
                        <item>11. Thy Affliction ſhall iſſue in Honour and Advancement. When God exalts Righteousneſs thou ſhalt be with it, follow after it, have like fare with it; whether it be done in this World or the future. If in this Life you continue under theſe Depreſſions, yet the honour of a glorious Kingdom is reſerved for you at that day, <hi>when Judgment ſhall infallibly return to Righteouſneſs.</hi>
                        </item>
                        <item>
                           <hi>Laſtly,</hi> Hence it highly concerns you to conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, and ſearch into your Hearts, that you may know your own <hi>
                              <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>prightneſs</hi> and <hi>Righteouſneſs,</hi> for upon this depends all. None of theſe Privileges appertain to Hypocrites, or wicked Perſons in State. But no ſincere Soul ſhall fail of obtaining them, in one kind or other. Let your thoughts therefore be much imploy'd within. Reflect upon your ſelves and ſee what title you have to ſo rich Bleſſings. If you can approve your ſelves in In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tegrity to God, you ſhall have Comfort and Joy unſpeakable and full of Glory, (even in and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der your ſoreſt Tryals) from the experience of Divine Goodneſs in all theſe Particulars. Buſie therefore your Meditations mainly about this. Dive into the bottom of your own Hearts, to ſee whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther any hid Treaſure lie there. Never give your Thoughts reſt till they either find it, or bring
<pb n="361" facs="tcp:100687:192"/>it. You are undone, if Afflictions meet you rotten at Heart. Take no content in any thing, lay out your Thoughts about nothing elſe, till thy bring you in the aſſurance that there is a ſound root of Grace planted in your Souls. Let your Minds perpetually work this way. All thoughts will be, cannot but be troubling, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexing, till they be ſanctified by a Principle of Divine Life. Therefore,</item>
                     </list>
                  </item>
                  <item>2. Endeavour to gain Ability to give Law to your Thoughts, and duly to govern them. A Man can never enjoy Peace till he can command at home. Unruly Rebel Thoughts will ever be creating new Broyls. Maſter your Thoughts by Thoughts. Nothing is more imperious or impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent. Maſculine generous Cogitations poſſeſs a kind of Omnipotency, nothing can reſiſt them. Engage your Minds about important matters, and engage them thorowly, and thoſe Meditations will obtain the Empire. To think ſeriouſly of God, his Attributes and Providence, and dwell thereon; to take a full view of the <hi>Love and Blood<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed of the Son of God,</hi> his Covenant and the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſions of it, to conſider and weigh thorowly the Curſedneſs and Offenſiveneſs of Sin, the Glory of a vertuous Heart and Life; to take a due pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of the Terrour of Death, Judgment and Hell, and the Bleſſedneſs and everlaſting Joys of Heaven is the beginning of that Wiſdom, which alone will over-rule your Hearts for God. Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flections upon theſe things will break in with ſuch an Emphaſis, Energy, and Awe upon your Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences, that vain and evil Cogitations cannot bear up againſt them, but will be ſuppreſt and daſh'd out of Countenance. The <hi>Pſalmiſt</hi> with one of theſe Conſiderations, <hi>viz.</hi> that of the <hi>Divine, all<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penetrating
<pb n="362" facs="tcp:100687:193"/>Eye of Providence,</hi> ſuppos'd himſelf an overmatch for, and able as with <hi>a ſmooth Stone out of the Brook,</hi> to ſtrike dead the barbarous profligate <hi>Goliahs,</hi> that rag'd in the devaſtation and ſlaughter of the <hi>Heritage of the Lord,</hi> Ver. 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11. And what will not a multitude of ſuch Thoughts effect upon an attentive and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clinable Mind and Conſcience, where they are made Familiar, Domeſtick, and Perpetual Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions? If hereby thou attaineſt to victory over frothy, vile, corrupt Thoughts, that they dare no more make Inſurrections; a foundation is laid for an entire conqueſt over diſconſolate Thoughts, which are their Off-ſpring, acknowledging none other Original, but live, move and have their be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in them. For nothing hath power to diſcom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe us, till it firſt corrupt us. Sin firſt pollutes, then pains us. Till our Conſciences be wounded by it, they do not, cannot rationally worry us. Prevent the offence againſt God and you bind Conſcience to the Good-behaviour, and ſo to the Peace. Remove the Provocation to Heaven by true Repentance, and you put an end to, and <hi>non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuit</hi> the quarrels of Conſcience. Now this is done by nothing more effectually than by Thoughts. Indeed nothing can do it but by the inſtrumenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of Thoughts. When good Thoughts counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>work evil, then will refreſhing, ſolacing Thoughts overcome and eject diſquieting.</item>
               </list>
               <p>Make this then, Oh my Soul, thy firſt care, to ſet up God in thy Thoughts, to over-rule and guide them. Erect a Throne in thy Mind for the Son of God, give him there the ſole power of the <hi>Militia of Peace and War,</hi> and then amongſt other Oppoſers <hi>every thought will be brought into captivity
<pb n="363" facs="tcp:100687:193"/>to the obedience of Chriſt,</hi> 2 Cor. 10.5. If thy Thoughts acknowledge no external Soveraign, they will be ungovernable; without foreign aid too hard for thee. There is a Prince, the Prince of the Power of the Air, who hath already uſurpt and rules in the corrupt part of thy Mind, and leads thy Thoughts into rebellion againſt, and diſobedience to <hi>that</hi> which is the true Law of thy Mind, the remaining Principles of the Light and Law of Nature within thee, and alſo the Light and Law of the <hi>Spirit of Life in the Scriptures.</hi> And theſe two <hi>Satan</hi> and the corruption of thy Mind, are odds to the reliques of the Divine Image in thee. 'Tis therefore of abſolute neceſſity, that a higher Prince be admitted, <hi>The King of Glory, The Prince of Peace, to expel that ſtrong One, and keep thy Mind ſtayed in himſelf, that it may be kept in perfect Peace,</hi> Iſa 26.3. Let God have a <hi>Primacy of order,</hi> as well as <hi>Supremacy</hi> in thy Thoughts. Thus the <hi>Pſalmiſt</hi> here, the firſt thing in his Mind and Mouth is God. Let him ſo be in all thy Thoughts. Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon and Sanctifie, ſweeten all thy other Meditati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons with thoughts of God. So He, likewiſe in this Pſalm, <hi>[viz. God]</hi> fills up all, and is at every end and turn, in the Holy Man's Memory and Contemplations. That Thought which for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gets and leaves out <hi>God,</hi> may let in <hi>Satan.</hi> Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin then, proceed, and end with <hi>God.</hi> This all preſcribe, even <hi>Heathens.</hi>

               <p>Conſideration then is the beginning of Conſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation. Meditation is the Medicine of the Mind, to heal its ſickly, becauſe diſorderly, turbulent, unruly Paſſions. If thou wilt not, O my Soul, oblige thy ſelf to it, thou ſtifleſt thy Peace in the Birth, or ſtrangleſt it in the Cradle, and adopteſt thy Diſquiets a new, as if in Love with thine own Woe. But then if thou canſt not guide and rule thy Thoughts, if thou canſt not direct them to proper Subjects, and call them off from ſuch as are unſuitable, if they will be <hi>Lords</hi> and <hi>Maſters,</hi> and run without bidding in a licentious Imperiouſneſs,<note place="margin">Primum argumen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum compoſitae men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tis exiſtirpor, poſſe conſiſtere, &amp; ſecum morari. <hi>Seneca, Ep. 2.</hi>
                  </note> from one thing to another; and be no where fixt, they will get ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage by nothing; according to the Proverb of the <hi>Rowling Stone.</hi> Therefore</p>

                  <hi>Command thy ſelf in chief,</hi> is a good Monition of Mr. <hi>Herbert.</hi> If thou loſeſt the regiment of thine own Mind, and canſt not bridle the exor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitances of thy Thoughts, bring them to a beck, like one in <hi>Authority</hi> keeping them under con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troul; and if thou haſt not a good ſtock of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable
<pb n="365" facs="tcp:100687:194"/>matter, treaſured up in thy Memory, to entertain them with at all times, maintaining thy Juriſdiction and Dominion over them, to be able to divorce and divert them from any thing, to any thing, thou canſt never live in Tranquilli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and Peace. Thoſe Cogitations that break the pale, and run out of courſe, will ſtill be creating Civil Wars, and Combuſtions among thy Paſſions, and interrupt the Serenity of thy Conſcience.</p>
               <p>Hence it is that Meditation is not the immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate duty of, nor proper for the conſtitutionally Melancholick, whoſe temper it is to be too co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitabund, and their Diſeaſe to be altogether un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to biaſs their Thoughts, and to be too wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to lay out thoſe Cogitations rather upon any thing than what is Joyous and Comforting. Let ſuch make uſe of other Mens Thoughts, rather that their own, and be more in Company and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference, than Solitude and Soliloquies.<note place="margin">Neme eſt ex impruden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioribus qui relinqui ſibi debeat. <hi>Seneea</hi> Ep. <hi>10.</hi>

And if trouble of Heart for Sin degenerate into it, as ſometimes it does, 'tis good to ſet a guard upon it, to live un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Inſpection. A Man can never keep himſelf ſecure from Sins or Sorrows, that hath none to keep his Houſe but a dumpiſh Mind.

               <p n="3">3. <hi>Get a clear practical notion of God.</hi> This was the <hi>Pſalmiſt</hi>'s great relief. In every Diſtreſs he could find an accommodate ſuitable Satisfaction and Solace in God. Did the Wicked rage and revel in the Blood of Innocents? His Faith be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holds a revenging Hand ready to execute Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for them. Did thoſe preſumptuous <hi>Deiſts,</hi> incourage themſelves in Cruelty by renouncing Divine Providence? He underſtands and convinces them, that it ſuperviſes all, even to the very thoughts of the Heart. Did he feel the treache<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry and failure of Friends on Earth? He both knew and found a never failing Friend and Hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per in Heaven, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> In every Trouble and Exi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence he meets with God. Now had he been un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acquainted with his Nature and Perfections we ſhould have ſeen nothing of all this; and then in what deplorable Circumſtances would he have found himſelf, under thoſe ſurrounding Calami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties? Whence could he have taken any Encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement? Let us take a view of Men making no ſuch Reflections, and therefore its likely but little acquainted with ſuch Notions. And the Inſtance ſhall be in his own Companions, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 30.3. <hi>David</hi> and his Men return to <hi>Ziklag,</hi> find it burnt with Fire, their <hi>Sons</hi> and <hi>Daughters</hi> taken Captives; wherefore, <hi>ver.</hi> 4. <hi>They lifted up their Voice and wept, till they had no more power to weep.</hi> Ver. 6. <hi>And</hi> David <hi>was in great diſtreſs, for the People ſpake of ſtoning him, becauſe the Soul of the People was bitter, every Man for his Sons and for his Daughters.</hi> Here was wild work. What fury of Paſſion, firſt in <hi>Grief,</hi> next in <hi>Rage;</hi> firſt they ſwelt in Tears, then would ſwim in Blood; and
<pb n="367" facs="tcp:100687:195"/>what would they have been the nearer? To ſuch Exceſſes will the frenzy of a drunken Appetite lead Men, that are ignorant of God, or enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain no ſerious Conſiderations of his Excellencies, and their concern in the Government of the World. Now behold, did not an other Spirit rule in <hi>David,</hi> a Man acquainted with God? Yes, a brave Heroical Spirit, <hi>Ver.</hi> 6. David <hi>encouraged [fortified, garriſon'd] himſelf in the Lord his God.</hi> Mark, His knowledge of God, and Intereſt in God, now mightily bore up his Heart, and ſtood him in very good ſtead, elſe might his Spirits have ſunk with theirs. But whilſt they were impotent through <hi>effeminate</hi> or <hi>diabolical Paſſion,</hi> he was ſtrong in God. Their puling and peeviſhneſs, did emaſculate their Hearts, and melt them into Puſillanimity and Cowardice, that they did not dare to confront and face this preſent hardſhip: but he became Couragious and Valiant in God, ſo as with an undaunted, maſculine Fortitude, and greatneſs of Mind, to triumph over, and outface the imminent Storm, and work his way through it, though with redoubled Violence, from both Enemies and Friends, it ruſh'd upon him.</p>
               <p>And truly ſince all our Comfort is originally, and eminently, and conſummately in God, 'tis impoſſible to enjoy any ſound Quiet, and Heart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe, under ignorance of him. For how ſhould a Man be able to draw and derive Comfort from he knows not what? But if he ſee that fulneſs of all delectable Joys in God, which are all-ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient to relieve his Mind, and compenſate his ſoreſt Troubles, (as the Love of God in Chriſt will) and contemplate, ſtudy, and dwell upon that infiniteneſs of Soul-ſatisfying Good, till the
<pb n="368" facs="tcp:100687:196"/>inviting amiableneſs raviſh his Deſires, command his Delight, engage his Soul in the moſt vigorous purſuit and endeavours to gain an Intereſt there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in; he ſhall not fail to obtain that ſweet reviving Solace and Peace, in the moſt acceptable ſeaſon, which will place him as in a corner of Heaven. Our Sorrows are more than half remov'd, when we gain a ſight of their moſt efficacious Reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies. If a Man at unawares have drunk Poyſon, 'tis no ſmall ſatisfaction to ſee and be ſure of a prevalent Antidote. Deſpair is the ſting of Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeries. Be the Storms and Surges never ſo high, and beat upon us with ſeemingly the moſt fatal Violence, yet if our Hope can but meet with any Anchor-hold, if we can gain a ſight of Land, if we behold a ſufficiency of Help and Security there, our Deſpondencies only are Shipwrack'd, we e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcape. Thoſe Hopes can never periſh that ſteer towards Heaven. If our Courſe be guided with an Eye upon the Star, 'tis ſafe. But if the very Heart deſpair,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Pſal.</hi> 73.26.</note> and Hope be ſunk, yet that caſe cannot be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperate, that's under-taken by God. <hi>Almighty Love</hi> is never at a loſs, either in Ability or Will, to ſuccour thoſe whom it once Embraces; which if we underſtand, <hi>neither our Help, nor our Hope, can periſh from the Lord.</hi> Fix therefore thine Eye here.</p>
               <p>In ſumm, <hi>God is all in all,</hi> in him (if we will but oblige our ſelves thereto) may we behold infinitely more than enough to ſtill the raging of our troubled Minds, and all engaged in Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant to meet us more than half way. <hi>Pardon of Sin, Propriety in God,</hi> are there promiſed, and leaſt we ſhould object incapacity to enjoy and be happy in ſo rich and glorious Bleſſings, 'tis added
<pb n="369" facs="tcp:100687:196"/>as the Crown of all that he will diſpoſe and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare our Hearts for it, by engraving thereon his Holy Laws, by that means perfectly removing all obſtructions to our Hopes, and occaſions of our Fears, that with a full aſſurance we may en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter upon our Inheritance, of his Everlaſting Conſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations. This he hath moſt plainly revealed, this he does moſt fully accompliſh to his choſen Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants. If we be partakers of his Nature and I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage, through the Law of the Spirit of Life in our Hearts, ſetting us free from the Law of Sin and Death, all is our own; and how is it poſſible for him that knows all this, that really believes and feels it, by any ſcruples and jealouſies to make his Life miſerable.</p>
               <p>Diſpel then, Oh my Soul, thoſe Clouds and Miſts that benight thy Underſtanding, thereby turning the Day in thy Will and Affections into Darkneſs. Endeavour to open the Windows, that the Glory of God, in the Face of Chriſt, may ſhine upon thee with a powerful Ray, to warm, impregnate and ſpirit thee, with a new divine Fervour, Strength and Life. Study the Scriptures which are a bright Beam of the Sun of Righteouſneſs, a fair Pourtraicture of that Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal, Eſſential Word of God, who is the <hi>Bright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of his Father's Glory,</hi> the <hi>expreſs Image of his Perſon.</hi> Let thy Mind in its Meditation dwell continually here with delight.

               <p> Fix thy ſelf therefore, Oh my Soul, upon the right Baſis <hi>of Truth,</hi> leading to Goodneſs, and thou art above Gun-ſhot. Nothing can hurt thee, if it do not firſt debauch thee, thy Mind with un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>due Sentiments, and thy Heart thereby with cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt Notions, nothing can diſquiet thee, till it debaſe and abuſe firſt thy Judgment, and thy Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience by it. Good Intellectuals will promote good Morals. Entertain high, noble and worthy Conceptions of God, and every thing that guides to God, and this will ſingularly conduce to thy ſecurity againſt Vice, and to thy eſtabliſhment in Vertue, and thereby in tranquility of Mind. For two things concur to ſolid Conſolation, clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Apprehenſions, and calmneſs of Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence: Serenity above, Tranquility below. The worſt of Men may have the one, none but the godly wiſe have both. The Devil has Light enough in his Underſtanding, though he be the <hi>Prince of Darkneſs,</hi> his Notions are ſublime, but Peace has he none. A dreadful Storm may rage in the Conſcience, when the Sun ſhines clear in the Mind; Men of great Parts and Gifts, and deep Heads, have not alway the quieteſt Hearts. <hi>The ſimple <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nlearned,</hi> ſaith one, <hi>riſe up and take Heaven by Violence, whilſt we with all our Learning drop down into Hell.</hi> 'Tis well if more Scholars be not found in Hell than Heaven.

<pb n="372" facs="tcp:100687:198"/>it will be let looſe upon thee, arm'd with the greater fury, perhaps even in this Life; and it is more tolerable to be lug'd into Goodneſs, by a ſnarling, ſnatching, tearing Conſcience now, than have all thy Bones broke and devoured by it, and the roaring Lion of Hell in his den of everlaſting Darkneſs. Wo, wo be to that Man that never wanted, or was without reſt and quiet in his Mind. A dumb Conſcience is a dark one, and <hi>If the Light that is in thee be Darkneſs, how great is that Darkneſs?</hi> If nothing within thee did ever proclaim War, nothing has right to ſpeak Peace. He that never ſaw God as an Enemy, never yet ſaw Him as a Friend. If thou be ignorant of thy own State, thou are ignorant of God, unacquainted with his Peace, with his Joy. Thus, Oh my Soul, if thou be'ſt ambitious to enjoy any real approva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble quietneſs in thy Mind, thou muſt maintain in it clearneſs of Notion concerning God. But al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though there be Light in the Heavens, it may ſuffer an Eclipſe (or rather thou doſt, for the Light leaves not the Sun, but the Earth) if thy Corruptions, as an opaque Body interpoſe. Wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſs in the Heart oppoſes the efficacy of our Notions of God, that although we retain them, we are no better for them, therefore 'twould be better for us were we without them. None lie deeper in outer Darkneſs, than thoſe that aſcend higheſt in Light and Knowledge in this Life, but improve it not. <hi>He that knows his Maſter's Will, and does it not, (and ſo his Maſter and loves him not) ſhall be beaten with many ſtripes.</hi> Our Paſſions are proportionable to our Senſations. The more enlarged our Minds are, the more enlarged are our Hearts to receive Comfort from our raiſed Speculations, if we conſcionably improve them;
<pb n="373" facs="tcp:100687:198"/>but if not, ſo much the more Anguiſh, Vexation and Torment. He that knows moſt of God, knows moſt to torture and rack his Conſcience for ever, if like a Devil, he notwithſtanding it, rebel a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt God. If thy Illuminations do not warm thy Affections of Deſire and Love, they will a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waken thoſe bitter Paſſions of Fear, Grief, Hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror, and Deſpair, as anticipations and earneſts of Everlaſting Woes.</p>
               <p>Labour therefore to ſuperadd to thy know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of God a true Notion of thy ſelf, and thine own eſtate, abſolute and relative, of the latter by the former. For by what thou feeleſt thy ſelf to be in thy ſelf, muſt thou judge what thou art in relation to God; and thus thy inward ſenſe muſt bottom thy Faith, <hi>i. e.</hi> thou mayſt have good ground to believe that God has <hi>juſtified, pardoned, accepted, adopted thee, and will ſave thee,</hi> if thou feel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt by inward ſenſe, that he hath <hi>Regenerated and Sanctified thee.</hi> Thus the <hi>Pſalmiſt</hi> ere he claim Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priety in God, <hi>ver.</hi> 22. lays the Foundation of that Aſſurance in Conſcience of <hi>Innocency and Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, ver.</hi> 21. Admit this to be meant of particular limited <hi>doing harm to none, good to all,</hi> or only to the <hi>Concern'd,</hi> viz. <hi>his Enemies, that ſought his Life:</hi> Yet ſince 'twas ſuch as could approve it ſelf to God, 'twill infer univerſal. For particular Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> is not to be pleaded before God, if it be but <hi>Hypocritical;</hi> and ſuch it is, if its Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, Motives, Ends, be unſound. But if theſe be ſound, they will certainly be Introductive of, nay they are <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſal Righteouſneſs:</hi> That is, if <hi>Love to God and Goodneſs, reſpect to his Will and Command, and an Eye to his Glory,</hi> lead and induce thee to Act, and regulate thee in harmleſſneſs, and juſt dealing with Men; they will not permit
<pb n="374" facs="tcp:100687:199"/>thee to reſt there, but with the ſame Efficacy and generous Violence urge and command thee into <hi>Sobriety</hi> and <hi>Godlyneſs:</hi> Yea Love to God and Goodneſs, is eminently both. Particular Juſtice then without Univerſal is mere <hi>Hypocriſie,</hi> and upon a bottom ſo baſe, ſo weak, ſo ſandy, no wiſe Man dare build the confidence to ſay, <hi>My God,</hi> no nor arrogate to himſelf a privilege of ſo noble and eminent a Nature, no nor laſtly would a ſerious Conſiderer ſo much as dare to mention Innocency and Righteouſneſs toward Man, in a ſolemn Addreſs to God, without a ſecret check from his own Conſcience for, and a ſerious de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>precation anent his own Injuſtice, and Nocency before the <hi>Divine Majeſty;</hi> had he not ſome in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Teſtimony of his Uprightneſs. We will then adventure to ſuppoſe, this carriage toward Man to be only an inſtance of that <hi>Cátholick Since<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,</hi> whereof the <hi>Pſalmiſt</hi> was an excellent <hi>Pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tern,</hi> and mentioned as an aggravating Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, inhancing the guilt of theſe Perſecutors that <hi>brake in Pieces God's People, ver.</hi> 3. <hi>Viz.</hi> That they did this without any manner of Provocati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, merely out of Malice againſt their Goodneſs and Relation to God, and him in particular, only upon falſe and ungrounded ſurmiſes.</p>
               <p>However this be 'tis certain, that if a Man do not partake of the <hi>Divine Nature, in Holineſs, in Faith, Vertue, Knowledge, Temperance, Patience, Godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, Brotherly Kindneſs, Love, he can never make his Calling and Election ſure,</hi> 2 Pet. 1.4, 5, 6, 7, 10. <hi>i. e.</hi> except a Man know God experimentally in having his Image renew'd upon his Soul, he can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver know God comfortably in any true aſſurance of his Love and Favour, and pardoning Grace; therefore never ſolace himſelf with the being,
<pb n="375" facs="tcp:100687:199"/>much leſs <hi>abundance of Peace.</hi> Thus then if thou know'ſt not God, thou knoweſt not thy ſelf; if thou know'ſt not thy ſelf, thou knoweſt not God. Here therefore, Oh my Soul, lay out thine en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours and cares, to get a true underſtanding of thy ſtate, whether truly Sanctified. Thou haſt no true peace if not born again to it. Get a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct notion concerning the <hi>New Birth</hi> in general, and thine own in particular: For thou haſt no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to do with any thing in God, if thou be'ſt not again <hi>begotten of God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Laſtly,</hi> Endeavour to attain a clear notion of <hi>the Covenant of Grace,</hi> its Nature, terms, and Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligation. For, be there never ſo much Comfort in God, and never ſo much need, and diſpoſed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in thee for it; yet what can make God ſo far a Debtor to thee, as to neceſſitate him to beſtow it on thee, if he do not oblige himſelf thereto? To that Covenant then do'ſt thou owe all thy right unto, and hopes of enjoying God, and his Conſolations. If thou found not thy confidence there, 'tis loſt, and thy ſelf alſo. No wiſe Man will neglect the peruſal of thoſe Deeds, by which he holds his Inheritance. Thy Comforts are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed but only <hi>Copy-bold,</hi> look to it.</p>

Leaſt therefore an error be found in the very Foundation of all, in that which a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove all things is moſt eſſential to, and differenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al of true Comfort, my next Rule is about that.</p>
               <p>

               <p>See to it then, Oh my Soul, that thou be form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed after the Similitude of God, as ever thou hopeſt for Satisfaction, in and from him. Conformity to the Divine Will in its Precepts, is indiſpenſibly required in order to inheriting the Promiſes.

To thy Work then, or take thy doom; converted thou muſt be, or comforted thou canſt not be. Oh! as thou ioveſt thy Life, thy Peace, and an everlaſting ſtate of Glory and Felicity in Heaven, retire into thy

Oh wretched Soul! who ſhall deliver thee, who ſhall relieve thee?

<pb n="385" facs="tcp:100687:204"/>of thy Power, I engage my ſelf to the uſe of all poſſible means of thy appointment, to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs all Motions to Sin, to ſtrengthen and renew my Reſolutions dayly, to eſtabliſh me againſt Temptations, and carry me on in an aſſiduous Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe of Repentance, till I have no more Sin to repent of, and yet will not account this any A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mends for the Wrong I have done thee, but in an abſolute Renunciation of all that I am, can be, or do, my repenting it ſelf, my holy Duties, my ſtriving againſt Sin, the World, the Devil, and my Religious Performances, as altogether inſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient and unavailable, to give Compenſation, or ſecure me from Juſtice; I come deſpairing of my ſelf, and all the ſtock I can be furniſh'd with at home, hopeleſs and helpleſs by the whole world, and in an humble and hearty Proſtration of Soul, throw down my ſelf at thy feet, ſeeking Relief, where alone it is to be found, and that is in thy ſelf, <hi>Oh Lord,</hi> thy Son and Spirit; and therefore with my whole mind, will, deſire, delight, and ſtrength, I freely, heartily, fully give up my ſelf, all my Powers and Poſſibilities, unto thee alone, avouching Thee only to be my God, and All-ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Goodneſs, and Happineſs; and therefore, with a lowly Reverence and Submiſſion, I caſt my ſelf as thy ſworn Vaſſal, at thy gracious Foot-ſtool, in a ſincere and abſolute Choice and Acceptance of Thee, <hi>O bleſſed Trinity, Father, Son, and Holy Ghoſt,</hi> for my ſole Portion and Reſt, dedicating my ſelf from my very inmoſt Soul to Thee, <hi>O Heavenly Father,</hi> as my Soveraign <hi>Creator,</hi> Owner, and Governour, to be wholly, and unreſervedly Thine, entirely at thy Diſpoſal, from the very bottom of my Heart, devoting the Remainder of my Spirits, Strength, and Life univerſally to thy

<pb n="387" facs="tcp:100687:205"/>Words, and Actions; with a thorow pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe and endeavour to take the higheſt Care, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Aids of thy Grace, both to conform in e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very thing thereto, and boggle at no difficulties, dangers, or ſufferings, which I may expect, or meet with, in theſe thy ways, but perſevere there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in to the end; neither ſhall any Corruption with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, or Temptation from without, have my heart, or liking, or allowance, ſo as to withdraw my Soul from theſe Holy Reſolves. For which end, I caſt my ſelf whole and entire upon thy Free Grace, and Almighty Power, <hi>and Holy Spirit, to work in me, both to will, and to do all, according to thy good pleaſure,</hi> being firmly engaged to be Thine, and to take Thee to be Mine, without a Moments farther Procraſtination. <hi>Come Holy Ghoſt, Eternal God,</hi> and breathe into my Soul, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe thy Gifts and Graces, communicating thy Power, to a poor impotent ſuccourleſs Sinner, that here, lo! conſecrates himſelf to Thee, and with a ſelf-reſigning Spirit, reſolves to venture all upon thy Conduct and Influence, to be at thy Beck and Command in all things, not knowing, nor being able, nor therefore willing to do a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thing without thee. Inſpire my Mind, direct my Heart, awe my Conſcience, regulate my Life, ſtrengthen and uphold my goings, that notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding mine own inſufficiency, I may by Thee be enlarged in heart, to run in the ways of thy Commandments. And now, <hi>Merciful God, Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, Son, and Holy Ghoſt,</hi> (through that All-ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Merit, that has procured all Bleſſings) ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept of me, and own me, as none of mine own, but thy Portion and Inheritance, who have taken Thee to be mine.</p>
               <p>This, this, O my Soul, is the <hi>One thing needful
<pb n="388" facs="tcp:100687:206"/>to be done in good earneſt, ſpeedily, with an uncontroul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Bent and Steadineſs of Will, and never to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pented of.</hi> I am pained in my very Soul for, and heartily bewail my Neglects, Deferrings, and A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſations. And here I am, bleſſed Lord, ſetting to my Seal, and firmly binding my ſelf in this my Baptiſmal <hi>Covenant,</hi> with an irreverſible purpoſe to act all the remainder of my Life, thro' thy Mercy and Aſſiſtance, only according to the Tenour of it.</p>
               <p>Be ſerious then here, O my Soul, or thou ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jureſt all ſolid Conſolation. Thou canſt never en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy good Hopes without a good Conſcience: If thou deſireſt to build high in thy Comforts, be ſure thou lay a good Foundation. If thou never enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt into ſuch Meditations and Reſolutions as theſe, bid everlaſtingly adieu to all true Contentation. If thou do not really turn to God, thou turneſt away thy Peace. The <hi>Holy Ghoſt</hi> will never be a Comforter, where He is not a Converter. <hi>Except thou be born again of Water, and the Spirit, thou canſt not enter into the Kingdom of God, the Kingdom of Peace.</hi> See to it therefore, that thou be raiſed from thy Death in Treſpaſſes and Sins, as ever thou deſireſt a Reſurrection of thy Joys. No Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, no Peace.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Having thus begun, go on: <hi>Make Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance Mortification, Watchfulneſs, Faith, Love, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignation to the Will of God,</hi> thy daily uninterrupt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Exerciſe; and endeavour to grow in all, and be upright in all, elſe all's nothing. Make Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerity thy great Aim and Endeavour. <hi>Hypocriſie</hi> is Heritor no where but in the Land of Darkneſs, and diſmal Woe. Thy Joys will reſemble their Parents. If they be a Cheat, ſo will they alſo. Be really good, and eminently ſo too. <hi>Aut Caeſar, aut nullus.</hi> Lean Graces do but devour fat Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts,
<pb n="389" facs="tcp:100687:206"/>never enjoy them. The ſweeteſt promiſes yield no laſting Refreſhment, to fickle hearts un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſtabliſhed with Grace. If thy Spiritual Strength be ſmall, when thy ſtanding in Chriſtianity is great, ſome ſecret Diſeaſe keeps thee down. Thy Stomach is foul, makes no good Digeſtion, ſome under-ground Corruption draws in that Nutri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, thoſe Spirits that ſhould invigorate and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe thy Graces, like a Worm in the Paunch or Bowels, feeding upon that, which ſhould feed thee, and ſo defrauding thee.</p>
               <p>Kill then thou muſt, or be kill'd: Repentance and Faith, and Mortification, and Watchfulneſs, alone muſt ſublevate thee. Engage thy ſelf here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, and make theſe a daily Task. Let not thy Sloath, the World, or any ſweet Luſt, raviſh thy Heart into an hours Neglect, no not a Moments, Reſolve and act with the firſt, and to the utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt. Thou art upon the Pits Brink, ready to drop down into everlaſting Horrours, and till thou repenteſt, haſt no Foot-hold; nay, thy Foot is already ſlipt, thou art tumbling down head-long, and no Mercy can or will hold thee up, but only as far as it engages thee in Repentance. This is the ſole Relief that thou eanſt have from Heaven; nothing elſe can bring thee back, raiſe thee out of the Ditch, return thee into a ſtate of Safety, but only thy returning this way to God. 'Tis abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely impoſſible, under the preſent Oeconomy of Divine Grace, for Mercy it ſelf to ſave thee, to ſatisfie thee with Peace, without Repentance: And no leſs impoſſible for thee to ſatisfie thy ſelf, in the ſoundneſs of thy firſt Repentance, without Cordial Reſolutions, Cares, Endeavours, in a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond daily life-long Repentance and Mortification.</p>
               <p>Go over again then with this Work, never
<pb n="390" facs="tcp:100687:207"/>preſent thy ſelf to the Lord without this Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, of a broken contrite Heart: As thou reneweſt thy falls, renew thy riſing by Repentance. That day upon which thou ſinneſt not, repent not; but be ſure thou omit this Duty upon none other. If there be any failures in thy firſt Work, a recog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition and renewal of it may redintegrate and rectifie thee. No Man is hearty in that Work, which he is loath to reiterate. Suſpect that Repentance which ſtands all alone in a ſingle act, and hath no Seconds. Be dayly therefore ſearch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thy Heart, and examining thy Life, caſt up thy Accounts at even , reckon with God, and thine own conſcience, for the day and all thy Life paſt, that thou may'ſt not lie down a Debtor to Juſtice, leaſt it be requir'd of thee ere the Morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. This is ſafe, and uſe will make it ſweet. Should a Traytor to God and thine own Soul lodge with thee in peace but for a Night, with what face could'ſt thou preſent thy ſelf before thy Judge, ſhould he arraign thee, and tell thee <hi>this Night ſhall thy Soul be required of thee.</hi> 'Tis dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous to dally with Sin, deſperate to irritate God. The Curſe of any one Sin unrepented of, and the Wrath and Fiery Indignation of God, are no eaſie Pillows to lay thy head upon. Thy ſleep will then be ſweeteſt when thy Sin is ſoureſt; and thy Reſt will be moſt refreſhing and comfortable, upon the ſoft Downy Bed of a good and pure con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, purged by Repentance, purifyed by Faith.</p>
               <p>But 'tis not enough to forſake thy Sin and turn to goodneſs, with a broken, bleeding Heart; but the root of Sin muſt be bound about with a Hoop of Iron, that it may be deaden'd and ſpring out no more. <hi>Crucifie</hi> then the <hi>Fleſh and the World,</hi> and be Crucified to them, and deny ſo as to <hi>mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifie
<pb n="391" facs="tcp:100687:207"/>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ngodlineſs,</hi> as well as <hi>Worldly Luſts,</hi> elſe thou art not <hi>taught by the Grace of God that brings Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> Tit. 2.11. Repentance cuts off the Bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches (the acts of Sin) that are already ſprouted out; but thy cares muſt not only reſpect what is paſt or preſent, but what may be in future. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore muſt thou engage thy preventive cares and endeavours in <hi>Mortification.</hi> Draw out the Heart-Blood of thy Luſts by cutting them off intirely from thy Heart and Affections. That accounted ſo truculent a Word of <hi>Caeſar</hi> to his Soldiers at <hi>Pharſalia, ſtrike at the face,</hi> which gave him the Victory, is no cruelty, but good policy here, and mercy to thy ſelf, and will be Crown'd with like Succeſs. That which is moſt lovely in thy Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions, moſt pleaſing to thy ſenſe; muſt be firſt laid at, ſtrike at their Beauty, turn that into deformity, and thou winneſt the Day. They live only in thy love, as far as approving themſelves to thy carnal Affections, whence they are call'd <hi>Luſts.</hi> Set up a Cherub with a flaming Sword turning every way, to keep them out of that their <hi>Paradiſe,</hi> and to guard thy Heart that Tree of Life, and thou effectually condemneſt them to an irremediable Mortality; thou really executeſt and deſtroyeſt them.</p>
               <p>Eſpecially if hereto thou ſuperadd the Exerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of Faith, and its ſocial Graces. For to cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifie Sin without Faith, deriving vertue and ſtrength from the Croſs, <hi>i. e.</hi> the merit of Chriſt, or that Holy Spirit and his Aid, which Chriſt by his merit purchaſed, is not at all to be hoped. It would never have had its Chriſtian Name from the Croſs, if this had no Influence upon <hi>Mortifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi> The <hi>Moral</hi> is pretty, but ſhort of that Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection of the <hi>Spiritual,</hi> to which we are directed

'Tis the Work of Grace, ſubduing the Sins that are contrary to it; eſpecially the Corruption of Nature. The Work of Grace in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluenced by the Holy Ghoſt. The Spirits work by Grace, in relation to Chriſt and his Crucifixi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; wherein the grace of Faith in ſpecial hath a peculiar Province. I mean not Chriſtianity in general, which ſometimes is entitled Faith; but that particular Grace which the Old Teſtament oft calls Truſt, the <hi>New, committing our Souls to God.</hi> When in a ſenſe of Sin, Impotency, and Emptineſs, we give up our ſelves to God in Chriſt, entruſting our Souls with him, and expecting all from him alone, in the way of his Covenant and Promiſes; which hope is an inſeparable fruit of Faith, and therefore included with it in the ſame title of Truſt, which is indeed both. Thus then
<pb n="393" facs="tcp:100687:208"/>do Chriſtians mortifie Sin: Being ſenſible that they are inſufficient by the power of their own reaſon and moral Vertue, to get the Victory o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver Original Corruption, and evil Habits, they apply themſelves to God in the Name of Chriſt; not only owning all Chriſtian Doctrine, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beying all Chriſtian Precepts, which are remote conditions and helps of Mortification; but in ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial conſidering that Chriſt by his merit procured power againſt Sin, as well as Pardon, which both are given upon no other account, but only for the ſake of Chriſt; therefore they beg of God, that according to his promiſe, he would <hi>ſubdue Iniquities,</hi> Mic. 7.19. He would graciouſly pleaſe to beſtow upon them, for Chriſt's ſake, that ſtrength, <hi>by his Spirit in their inner Man,</hi> which may enable them to conquer, and keep under their Concupiſcence, <hi>the Fleſh, with the Affections, and Luſts thereof,</hi> and upon the help of his Spirit, ſo beg'd, they rely, and depend, and truſt to it, in every aſſault and motion of Sin, lifting up their Hearts to God in Chriſt, for renewed Power to reſiſt and ſuppreſs it, and keep themſelves pure; diſtruſting themſelves, that they may put their whole truſt in the living God, upon whom thus fixing their affiance, they wait in patience and watchfulneſs, and the uſe of his Ordinances; for <hi>Chriſt to be made their Sanctification and Redemption,</hi> from the Dominion, and Tyranny, or <hi>Rebellion</hi> of Sin, which by degrees is granted them; and this Exerciſe of Faith in Prayer, and Prayer means, is the immediate and next condition of the grant of power againſt Sin; which is followed with the uſe both of Rational and Scriptural Conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, care to prevent all occaſions, or irritations of Concupiſcence, and other evil Diſpoſitions; an
<pb n="394" facs="tcp:100687:209"/>early endeavour to ſuppreſs the firſt Motions and Luſtings, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but the power of theſe is not truſted to, as ſufficient, but Gods alone, in the uſe of theſe helps, to overcome and crucifie the evil of their Natures, and all that are rooted in it, and flow from it: Act then ſolely under God, look after ſuch an effectual Faith, that carrying thee above all Viſibles to the inviſible God; will under his Influence purifie thy Heart, work by Love, and reduce thy Will into Subjection to God, and grow herein daily.</p>

Love is all in all. Thy Repentance, thy Faith, thy Hope, thy Prayers, thy Vows, thy Obedience, are good and acceptable, if Spirited with Love, without it they (and all beſide, that thou canſt poſſibly be, and do) are but all as a Sacrifice of Swines Blood, and bleſſing an Idol: there's no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of Life in them, nothing of Soul, becauſe nothing of God, becauſe nothing of Love. <hi>Oh love the Lord then,</hi> Oh my Soul, with all thy mind,

Time may come when all thy preſent Senſations may be ſo cloudy, that thou canſt not ſee a peep of day; canſt not from any thing that thou feeleſt, conclude that thy ſtate is right before God. But if at ſuch a ſeaſon and hour of temptation, thou be'ſt able to call to mind, that upon due trial, when in a ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber and compoſed calm of Thoughts, the Lord ſatisfied thee upon ſure and indefeiſible Evidence, that thy Heart was truly changed, and that thou waſt (as a <hi>New Creature</hi>) <hi>in Chriſt Jeſus;</hi> and that thy Objections, and misdoubtings, and tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to the contrary were thorowly anſwered.

Make ſure in this manner to lay up, and reſerve a good ſtock and treaſure of Experiences, if thou deſireſt Riches of Comfort, yet content not thy ſelf with the old, but make new. To remember what thou did'ſt enjoy, and feel <hi>in the days of the right Hand of the Moſt High,</hi> may revive thee but to ſenſe, and feel it at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent much more.

Amend what was amiſs in former actings, which gave Satan advantage to redintegrate thy Troubles, and this will eſtabliſh thy Peace upon a ſecurer, and more unexceptionable baſis. 'Tis not poſſible to refute the Devils Objections againſt thy ſincerity, by a method more effectual, than a more ſerious care to act all over again ſincerely, which he tempts thee to ſuppoſe was done un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoundly.

Indeed
<pb n="402" facs="tcp:100687:213"/>the Gift is but the Body, Grace the Soul of Prayer; and the moſt Eſſential Grace of Prayer properly ſo call'd, <hi>viz. Petition is Deſire,</hi> the moſt efficaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous is <hi>Faith.</hi> For I doubt not to give the title of <hi>Grace</hi> to ſincere <hi>Deſire,</hi> notwithſtand that it hath been exploded upon a reaſon ſomething odd, <hi>viz. That deſire of Grace, is no more Grace, than deſire of Health, Riches,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>is Health; Riches,</hi> &amp;c. A ground doubly fallacious; for 1. It doubly miſre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſents the contrary Opinion, which 1. only pronounces concerning ſincere Deſires. 2. Means not, that the Deſire is formally the Grace, and every Grace deſired. But if <hi>upright Deſire</hi> be not a Grace, though not the Grace deſired, neither is <hi>upright Delight,</hi> nor conſequently <hi>upright Love,</hi> whereof theſe are the ſpecial and ſole Ingredients; Deſire being as eſſential as Delight. And if ſome ſincere deſire of ſome Graces, be not inchoative<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the Graces deſired, or an Effect or Act iſſuing from them, (which amounts to the ſame thing, and will ſubſerve to the ſame end, for which that Propoſition is uſed, <hi>viz.</hi> to ſatisfie the weak but ſincere Chriſtians, that queſtion their Grace,) I cannot tell how that of our Saviour is intelligible <hi>Matth.</hi> 5.6. <hi>Bleſſed are they that hunger,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>i. e.</hi> deſire ſincerely as all agree. The Ungracious, Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>righteous are not Bleſſed, but Curſed; now ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the ſuppoſition of the Text theſe have nothing to entitle them to Bleſſedneſs, ſave this <hi>Hunger, &amp;c.</hi> or <hi>Deſire,</hi> therefore this Deſire con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutes them ſo far Righteous, as not to leave them liable to the curſe due to the Unrighteous. 2. It miſtakes and miſſes the caſe, for ſure there's a World of difference betwixt Internal Diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of Mind, and External Poſſeſſions. One
<pb n="403" facs="tcp:100687:213"/>more imperfect diſpoſition of Mind, is capable of being changed into, or growing up to a more perfect habit, and therefore may be inchoatively that habit; and alſo it is very poſſible, that the firſt actings of a Grace already received may be in a deſire of that Grace, as well as the more mature ſtate of that Grace, may diſcover it ſelf in ſtrong deſire after a greater meaſure of it ſelf. 'Tis certain that the more grown and vigorous our Faith is, the more do we deſire the increaſe of it, ſo <hi>Delight, Hope, Fear of God, Humility;</hi> and in ſumm, no Man can ſincerely deſire any Grace, without Grace, becauſe without Grace there can be no Sincerity, that is the Adjunct without the Subject: Sincerity being the Eucracy, or good Conſtitution, and Form, and Beauty of Grace, which cannot be ſound if it be not. Now to transfer this to External Enjoyments, or bodily good things, is to leap over the Hedge into a ſophiſm of no very graceful Name. I think there are other more ſolid Methods, to club down preſumptuous Hypocritical Deſires, than thus to break the bruiſed Reed and rotten Stick with one and the ſame blow I do not ſay that deſires of Comfort are Comfort, I know very well that Deſires, in no manner of Gradation or Modifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion can be a ſpecies of Comfort, as Deſires may be of Grace; nor an inferiour degree of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort neither. Yet though they cannot be formally Comfort, they may be objectively Comfortable. That is ſincere deſires upon reflection, will be matter of Comfort; 'twill be a rejoycing to a Man's Heart, to find therein thoſe hungring and thirſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing deſires, which the foremention'd Scripture recommends. I know not that any can ever have
<pb n="404" facs="tcp:100687:214"/>reaſon to repent, of <hi>hearty Breathings and Pan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings after the Living God,</hi> and that plentitude of all deſireable <hi>Joys,</hi> in fruition of his tranſcendent Perfections, which is ſufficient to repleniſh and anſwer all the cravings of the moſt enlarged Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petite, even unto Satiety. And 'tis certain that without ſuch deſires, Divine Bounty it ſelf, infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite though it be, will not adminiſter the leaſt drop of the Cup of Conſolation, as 'tis called, <hi>Jer.</hi> 16.7. Indeed ſince 'tis <hi>God which comforteth thoſe which are caſt down,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.6. we have lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle ground to expect his Comforts, if we never deſire them, and little evidence can we give of our true deſires, if we convert them not into Prayers; nor can our Prayers prevail if not made in Faith, <hi>Jam.</hi> 1.5, 6. For that's the Grace of Graces, which muſt beat every end, or nothing can proſper. The Son of God himſelf, the Lord, Owner, and Poſſeſſor of all, yet did not obtain the Comforter for us without <hi>Prayer, Joh.</hi> 14.16. And 'tis no diſhonour to be ty'd to the ſame Conditions with our <hi>Redeemer,</hi> in things accommodate to our Nature and State. If he procured the Cauſe of Comfort, he will bleſs our uſe of the means, which if we neglect we (what in us lies) fruſtrate the <hi>Interceſſion of Chriſt,</hi> and by omiſſion of our Duty of <hi>Prayer,</hi> which is a part even of <hi>Natural Religion,</hi> we cauſe, as to our ſelves, a denial and rejection of the <hi>Prayer of Chriſt</hi> himſelf. And how can we expect that God ſhould hear us Praying for our ſelves afterward, when we ſee a neceſſity to change our Minds, and ſue for that Mercy for our ſelves, which once we would not receive, or ſo much as deſire, as an anſwer to the <hi>Petitions</hi> of our <hi>Mediator.</hi>

               <p> Be not a Stranger to thine own Heart, yet do not think to dig thy Peace out of thine own Bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>els. If it be a comforting reviving thing to find in thy ſelf the truth of Grace, yet that refreſhing vertue of Grace it ſelf is from God. Whence we find ſome that although they be tolerably ſatisfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of their ſoundneſs, yet through Ignorance, or Inadvertency, or Melancholy, or Temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> cannot ſettle in a calm and quiet compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of Mind. For, as I ſaid, the Aſſurance of the truth of a Man's Grace, is only comforting, as it is the ground of his Aſſurance of the <hi>Love of God,</hi> of which if a Man be not ſatisfied, <hi>i. e.</hi> that true Grace is an infallible evidence, that God does embrace him with his ſpecial Love, and is at peace with him through Chriſt, his Conſcience will not be at reſt, for it cannot reſt in diſcord with God, whoſe Deputy 'tis in Man. Now ſome are ſo weak, as not to underſtand this; others ſo oppreſt with dumpiſhneſs of Spirit, as not to heed it; others ſo deluded by Satan as not to believe it; which miſts if not diſpell'd, damp the comfort of Grace.

<pb n="409" facs="tcp:100687:216"/>not to be inſiſted on in Competiton with an en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larged Heart. <hi>Take with thee Words, and turn un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Lord.</hi> Lord at thy bidding I will take thy Words which thy ſelf here preſcribes, <hi>Hoſea</hi> 14.2, 3. They ſhall be my ſtinted <hi>Liturgy;</hi> none can tell which will be acceptable to thee better than thy ſelf. What are they? <hi>Take away Iniquity and receive us graciouſly, ſo will we render the Calves of our Lips.</hi> What's that? The ſubſtance is <hi>Praiſe:</hi> But ſome Antients thus deſcant upon it. <hi>Calves</hi> not of our <hi>Stall,</hi> Mal. 4.2. but <hi>Lips.</hi>] When a Calf or other Beaſt was to be Sacrificed (to which this is an alluſion) God required the <hi>Blood, the Fat,</hi> and ſometimes the <hi>Fleſh,</hi> but never the Skin and Hair; theſe were to be carried away and burnt in another place. The <hi>Blood</hi> of theſe Calves of the Lips is <hi>Faith</hi> in the Blood of Chriſt, which is the Life of Prayer and Praiſe. The <hi>Fat,</hi> pure, and holy Affection, and Grace, Sorrow, Deſire, Love, Delight, Hope, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> The <hi>Fleſh</hi> is the matter, or thing pray'd for, Wiſdom, Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs, Sanctification, Redemption, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> The Skin and Hairs, the Words, and Expreſſions, with the Method, Mode, Order; which if alone, and not ſpirited with the former, are of no value with God, who looks at <hi>Things,</hi> not <hi>Words</hi> and <hi>Phraſes.</hi> They muſt indeed be brought to God in vocal Prayer, which is never a Duty, except when we joyn with others, and they with us, and we muſt ſee that all accord with, or do not diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agree from the general Rules of the <hi>Scripture.</hi> But 'tis a folly to think that we for theſe are more ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable in Perſon, or that our Prayers, the <hi>Fleſh,</hi> the <hi>Fat,</hi> the <hi>Blood,</hi> are more well-pleaſing to God. We muſt not lay any ſtreſs upon, put any confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
<pb n="410" facs="tcp:100687:217"/>in that, which God will not vouchſafe his Altar to Sanctifie.</p>
               <p>Offer then even this vocal Prayer: God ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pects in ſome caſes, this in Conjunction, but take heed, O my Soul, of relying upon it, as ſuch, <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>Skin</hi> without the other, in Separation. Whether form or no form, what matters it, 'tis but Skin and Hair. Why ſo much adoe about it? Give the main to God, or thou giveſt nothing. God will take off the Skin, and burn it; burn not thy Fingers about it; 'tis not for the Altar. Oh bring that chiefly which muſt be preſented there. God is a Spirit, what are Words to him? Oh let thy Prayers be all Spirit. Words are but the vehicle, ſometimes only <hi>Aereal,</hi> mere Wind, ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom <hi>Aethereal,</hi> defecate and pure Quinteſcence, without Froth and Vanity, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> However, O ſee thou that there be an Angel within; if there be not an Intelligence to turn about this Orb of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion; if a Soul do not animate this Body of Duty, away with it, to the dunghil with it, 'tis but mere Carrion. Bring <hi>the Male in thy Flock, not this corrupt thing.</hi> Thou canſt never derive Comfort from Heaven, if thou lay nothing upon God's Altar but Froth and Wind. Subſtantial Prayers, (and all ſubſtance is an inviſible, inward thing) and theſe alone introduce ſolid and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantial Conſolations.</p>
